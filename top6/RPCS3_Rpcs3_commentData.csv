The point of RPCS3 is to emulate the PS3, not to try and fully emulate the PS2 as well    All PS3s can play the PS2 Classics titles from the PS Store, so it makes some sense as to why the ability to play them on RPCS3 is implemented, but there's absolutely no point in emulating an entire second console when for one, there's already a very well-known PS2 emulator out there; and for two, only a relatively few real consoles can actually do it    If you want to play PS2 games then get PCSX2, because you'll be playing PS2 games much sooner than if you were to wait for RPCS3 to do it|2020-03-28 09:34:37|Kian-Stevens

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7853|2020-03-25 14:52:45|2020-03-26 12:21:55|It seems I forgot to update lib include path in rpcs3 project so it used libcurl from old path that was built without disabling FH4 Facepalm.    Btw clean 3rdparty/wolfssl/x64 if you will build this locally just in case.    This should work. If it does not I will return to static.    EDIT_0:  Ok then. I should rewrite configurations for libcurl so it can build as normal lib without a dedicated path but it can break unexpected things so I'll do that some other time.    EDIT_1:  Qt can be custom compiled to link statically against VC++ runtime but actually providing Qt specially built for rpcs3 on windows seems like more trouble than it is worth.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|Well there's something fishy afoot. There must be something wrong with the way the Azure is configured on RPCS3's end. On mine, the linux caching is excellent and beats out travis. You can see it [here](https://github.com/JohnHolmesII/rpcs3/pull/2). Windows builds are at least faster than appveyor, so we can yeet that into the sun.|2020-03-21 09:13:53|JohnHolmesII
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|@Nekotekina The pr works sometimes. Any environment variables exported can sometimes be corrupted by a single quote. It is random. Look at the Artifact for the windows build, a single quote is in the filename. SOmetimes the single quote shows up in the "BRANCH" variable, which breaks compiliation, since it is expanded by macros in main_window.cpp. I think I'll either have to report and wait for a response from Azure, or do a workaround by making that code read in a file or something. I already put in a workaround for the GitHub release description, but there is work needed for others.|2020-03-24 08:16:36|JohnHolmesII
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|Alright, well I've worked around all but one of the side effects. I think the changes to main_window are even for the best: rpcs3 version checking should be unified imo.    @AniLeo The "all but one" just happens to be something related to the release artifacts. The title of the release will have an apostrophe at the end, as seen [here](https://github.com/JohnHolmesII/rpcs3/releases/tag/build-480f2e013ae65265fca884ecd279cc24c4f63293). The description part (that has the hash and filesize) is properly protected against the bug, so it should be easier to parse. I think it should be easy to scrape the title tho and simply discard the final apostrophe, but I don't know the details of that on the website's end.    Other than that, I think is should be squared away.|2020-03-26 06:07:33|JohnHolmesII
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|As the website is right now it will work fine since it uses the tag name in URL which is correct, but you may want to fix that release name either way|2020-03-26 09:09:00|AniLeo

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|Well, in the mean time I simply inlined the hash for now. The script can always be changed later I suppose.    In addition, I made changes to how caching dependencies is done. The previous setup was rather poor, but now it is quite robust.|2020-03-27 05:40:54|JohnHolmesII
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7757|2020-03-11 01:37:16|2020-03-27 13:37:28|Well, I think due to the issues with RPCS3's azure pipeline being temperamental, the other changes I had planned are best reserved for another time. In addition, there is a dearth of options available for build caching on Windows. I'm looking into something rather hacky, but even if it works, it's best reserved for another PR. Azure is at least as fast as appveyor was, and is usually faster, so I think the PR is mergeable as is at this point.|2020-03-22 23:25:40|JohnHolmesII

Aspect ratio could likely just be the game being broken, would need to test on real 3D tv with real PS3 to confirm actual rendering resolution. Most 3D resolutions are not actually 16:9 but maybe it is expected that the image will be stretched to fill screen. They're usually smaller in width to account for the performance loss and I guess they're rendering in anamorphic. You can fix it by using stretch option for now while I think of a workaround.  2.

For ccache, you just need to install it from the repository.    My configure commands:  ```bash  cd build-release (some arbitrary location)  CXX=g++-9 CC=gcc-9 cmake ~/rpcs3-dev -G Ninja -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBPNG=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_FFMPEG=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_NATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS=ON -DUSE_COTIRE=OFF -DUSE_CCACHE=ON  ```  ```bash  cd build-reldeb (some arbitrary location)  CXX=g++-9 CC=gcc-9 cmake ~/rpcs3-dev -G Ninja -DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBPNG=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_FFMPEG=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUSE_NATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS=OFF -DUSE_COTIRE=OFF -DUSE_CCACHE=ON  ```    My build command:  ```bash  cd ~/rpcs3-dev  nice ninja -C /mnt/ccache/rpcs3-release  ```    Don't copy commands blindly.

When you later created the #7532 PR everything was fixed, but you closed it shortly after and the black screen regression remained.

See [this bug report.](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/issues/2502)    It's an unfortunate problem with spec, there is seemingly no way to tell the driver "I don't want you touching my passes, render them in any order". I suppose they assumed vulkan would only be used for games where you have control over when a pass starts and stops, but on rpcs3 we have to constantly start/stop to handle vulkan events that cannot be done when a pass is active (another asinine restriction in the spec). It seems for proprietary drivers, setting no dependency at all frees up the driver to do what we want, but RADV is following spec strictly which means things are just fucked. As for why NVIDIA's driver freaks out when any dependency is declared with any options - I have no idea. I'd have to reach out to someone from their end for advice and I'm not sure its possible to do so efficiently.|2020-02-16 14:28:33|kd-11

I see, that's fair.    > it's easier to miss something that isn't there than to miss something that is wrong.    The problems with this are the following:  - first, I didn't say nothing should appear in their place. In videogames it's usually a placeholder text / enum, and I think that's the way to go about it too.  - second, the people that are going to translate RPCS3 will definitely speak English (they have to be able to). This means that English text will very easily slip through the cracks, simply because people won't notice it's not in their language. Happens with me quite often for example, and I dare to bet it happened to you as well at least once.    > the Qt translation software    This however changes the situation, didn't know this is a thing. I'll join back to the Discord server and check things out maybe. If that's how it works, that's great then.    > I'd rather read something in english than not at all    Placeholder enums are crafted in a way that delivers the same key message as the given piece of text, still in English. The point of them is their formatting that gives it away, even to a simple end-user, that they should not be seeing that and should report the missing translation asap. It's also more generic and clean to have every single translation separate, including English.    This is a non-issue if the aforementioned translation software cleanly reports these missing translations though.|2020-02-05 01:18:56|dio-gh

It's not a big deal, so i don't see why not allow it. If we can show a game running at 500fps on my cpu it gives people a good indication, that it will run amazing even on bad hardware.

You should still be using 150% for 1920x1080p. If you're using "stretch to display" option then it doesn't matter for that either. I guessss you could be using 2317x1202 or 2124x1195 to try and get they height as close to 1200 as possible but it seems pointless to not just use 200% (1440p) at that point.

This is fine, but there's currently no way to tell the battery level anywhere above 20% when in-game.

The preset gradient currently goes from green at 100% to yellow at 50% to red at 0%. The function as it is right now works as intended, but is disabled (and thus optimized away) as there's no corresponding setting at this moment. If it is to be off by default, it shouldn't interfere with co-op experience, especially since every controller's LED is set to blue and needs to be manually set to a color of choice.|2020-01-12 16:18:13|Adiost

I rebased it on my own, which was quite troublesome, and pushed it to my own ds4 branch.  I also fixed some issues I had with the ui files at the same time.    You can just use my branch and push that code with your name.  Or I can just push that commit into your branch if it doesn't bother you that it has my name on it.    Btw: I didn't change anything in your code apart from the ui stuff (which also didn't change anything visually).

The LED battery indicator mode now supports configurable brightness (0-100), properly works with multiple controllers and is no longer limited to in-game. The pre-existing block that blinks the LED is now also user configurable. The LED button/color sample in `pad_settings_dialog` was removed (which makes the interface more consistent between the handlers), instead the unused space beside the Device type dropdown is now home to a battery level indicator and a button that opens a newly implemented `pad_led_settings_dialog`.     ~~Additionally, the height of `pad_settings_dialog` layout and the min height of the description label were altered in order to resolve the issues with handlers that require 4 lines.~~ This change was reverted in 36d3e36 since the new dimensions did not properly fit in a 720p screen. The pad png was scaled down instead, just enough to afford one more line for the handler description label.    ![A3ewoN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7739280/72375893-fe678d80-371d-11ea-87c1-8d5e001a6b5e.png)    ![ONrn9N](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7739280/72375905-045d6e80-371e-11ea-9919-19ea85ed22fb.png)  |2020-01-14 19:35:19|Adiost

The feature works as intended in-game, but we're not polling battery level while in settings dialog. Consider this: the user enabled LED battery indication at 50%, the LED becomes yellow. Then the user closes the dialog, keeps RPCS3 open and expects the LED to correctly indicate the battery level, but it will stay yellow until the settings are opened again or the emulation is started.    To make it even more consistent, I'll make it so the LED is reset back to a static color when pad thread is terminated.|2020-01-19 07:26:11|Adiost

The reason you may not be seeing any difference is that in most games, most setups will be choking on SPU performance anyway, so hobbling RSX throughput only increases the RSX load metric without much variance in ingame framerate. Its not possible that a real PS3 has several milliseconds of lag, which means the setting right now is largely hiding the Cell emulation lag and lower values will be more feasible in future as performance improves.|2020-01-13 18:21:11|kd-11

Because emulation code speed tends to be very inconsisent (unlike realhw where everything tends to be much more consistent) issues arising from games' race conditions may actually appear on **nearly all cpus, configs and gpu setups**.    To answer your specific question about "RSX optimizations", the answer is the opposite.  The faster RSX executes its' code, the more likely those races are likely to cause crashes.  Our SPU emulation is relatively slow compared to other parts (namely RSX, PPU) which helps causing more issues as well.|2020-01-15 01:35:56|elad335

Its important to also mention the type of media used, I suspect HDD and SSD will behave very differently.  So, @vietnam13231, is your rpcs3 loading from SSD or HDD?|2020-01-05 15:08:39|kd-11

There are a couple things to take into consideration about @vietnam13231's comment:    - An SSD will definitely help since there is a lot of file reading taking place. I'm on and HDD and the first time I load the game the speedup isn't that great. Closing the game and loading it again after files are already cached in memory is where I get the most benefit.  - Driver shader cashes are finicky (at least for me on AMD) and will sometimes decide to compile the shaders again instead of using the cached shaders, which is probably why @vietnam13231 got the long compilation step. The compilation step is essentially unchanged by this PR.|2020-01-05 15:38:31|Dravonic

However for merge I'd default to a limited block size (200? 500? 1000 at best?) because that very thing is likely to give the biggest improvement when it comes to any theoretical UI issues due to log buildup.

What this looks like in the game is that sometimes the call makes it through and you get a successful response whilst sometimes you will get a connection error from the server (more often an error than success).|2019-12-05 09:48:12|Jayveer

Since it is crucial that it is enabled for MSAA to work properly (in theory anyway, in practice drivers seems to not care), you need to log error if the feature is missing and AA is enabled.|2019-12-01 15:10:36|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/7016|2019-11-20 16:03:12|2020-03-22 14:00:40|It could depends on the code the compiler decides to generate. Not in this case, but when the size is known the compiler will try to avoid calling `memcpy()` directly.    You can play with the `-march` flag, with the `N` constant, and with the selected compiler in this example: https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/Aw5r9N    In x86 instructions, u means unaligned and a means aligned, but AFAIK since the Skylake architecture there isn’t any difference in execution between the two any more. This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t aim to attempt to make the compiler generate an aligned access for older architectures, of course, but optimising for that doesn’t seem very useful to me.    When the compiler generates a libc call though, I don’t think it will change anything indeed.|2020-03-05 20:04:40|linkmauve

Recent versions I say more or less 10 previous versions. Versions from August-2019 run fine.  The regrssion in peformance is before of 0.0.7-9123 and 0.0.7-9124.  About  "boost tekken 6 from 45fps to 60fps on some maps using am a8 7650k gt 730 clock at 4ghz"  Is the same speed if using an FX-6300 and GT 640.  Another detail is that some games has a huge slowdown in music tempo being in some games run 60 FPS and music tempo how if is 3 FPS or running in 5 FPS and music tempo 3 FPS even not enabling low spu thread and spu loop detection.  In games running with performance regression the log window is all time creating lines about each SPU and RSX new task being an detail that not had before being also an recent detail.  Games having a huge performance regression not has all SPU code being emulated and perhaps the problem is because SPU LLVM is trying find how emulate SPU code (red lines in log window) thus using very much CPU resulting in low performance.  Have games running more fast in recent versions and results are green lines in log window.  When in log window has several red lines the game has music tempo very slow or low FPS.  I had posted here because look how being related to changes in SPU LLVM.  Using ASMJIT also has huge drop in performance.    I need to say an HUGE THANKS for changes in how is allocated Vulkan memory compiler in NVidia GPUs that is now 300 MB. Before was 1 GB.  Thanks very much :)|2019-11-14 08:09:59|Augusto7743

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6941|2019-11-03 10:26:21|2019-11-05 19:07:23|This PR lowers the framerate a bit on my computer, from ~22 to ~21 fps, but this could also be due to the high variance, I’d need to measure the amount of frames in N seconds to give more precise results. But we [already established](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/6882#issuecomment-546855864) my current bottleneck is actually not starting to draw early enough anyway, so this may not be relevant.    On master, `rsx::convert_linear_swizzle_3d<unsigned int>()` takes 5.82% of the CPU, plus 1.50% for `__memmove_avx_unaligned_erms()`.    On this PR, `(anonymous namespace)::copy_unmodified_block::copy_mipmap_level<unsigned int, unsigned int>()` is taking only 4.09% plus 1.55% for `__memmove_avx_unaligned_erms()`.    On this PR plus #6948, `(anonymous namespace)::copy_unmodified_block::copy_mipmap_level<unsigned int, unsigned int>()` completely vanishes, and `__memmove_avx_unaligned_erms()` now takes 3.11% instead.    The time spent waiting for Vulkan events to complete stays about the same at ~33%, it seems to reach ~37% on the third case, but I’m not too sure about that, it could also just be that there is less to do on the CPU so it can spin loop more.    Note that all of that is on an i5-8350u CPU alongside its UHD 620 GPU, I expect the benefits to be much higher on weaker CPUs which have a stronger GPU.|2019-11-04 21:29:29|linkmauve

Ofc the graphics card has to be able to keep up in the first place. Compute operations are very heavy in terms of GPU interruption, and if you're on intel IGP, expect worse performance. Other GPUs however have a decent uplift, I've only been able to check RADV so far, but I gained around 7fps.|2019-11-04 21:50:47|kd-11

Maybe we can live with only on fix.    FM(): remove clamping. FMA(), FNMS() and FMS() do not need it, sow why should FM()?

Only local users build with march=native, appimages build with march=sse2 always. In fact, appimages don't even build with gcc at all, we use clang for the official builds. With that being said, you find a curious difference between GCC and Clang; clang does not allow the method definitions to even exist if the march level is below it; i.e if march is SSE2 all SSE3 intrinsics will be undefined methods and throw errors, hence the inline asm workarounds.|2019-10-28 13:04:37|kd-11

Multiversioning usually works if there is a fallback overload with the same function name marked with a "default" target.

As for the proposed solutions: The problem is that there is no true way for the windowing side to know what the driver side is using for surface dimensions. This is why we use suboptimal report if it is supported instead. i.e Just because the window changed and we know about it does not mean the driver is in agreement, there is indeed a ~1 frame latency, but this is fine as it is stable. Also gets around a user dragging the window frame to resize which causes a lot of problems and any sane implementation will reintroduce the same lag.  The way I see it, there are 2 possibilities:  1. Separate intel into 2 drivers and use manual mode for ANV, keeping the driver supported method for proprietary driver.  2. Optionally hide the window frame until the transition is finished if it is too distracting.|2019-10-22 10:55:59|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6829|2019-10-22 10:39:38|2019-10-23 09:19:47|Hi, thanks for your quick answer!    I know the driver side is ultimately the one deciding on the buffer dimensions, but it should do so in accordance with what the window system tells it to do, not the other way.  And that’s already how it is in rpcs3 with the swapchain creation requesting the current `client_width`/`client_height` from the Qt window.    I don’t have any Windows license to test the proprietary driver, so what follows is pure guess on my end and I’d welcome someone else to validate them.    On Wayland at least (I know much less about the X11 ways), there is no such frame of latency because the size of the surface is directly derived from the size of the buffer the WSI attaches to it.    I just tested on both Wayland and X11, there is no regression on X11 (which already supported fullscreen resize) with this PR, nor is there any additional bug during resize compared to current master.  Note that on X11 we also use anv, it’s only anv on Wayland which doesn’t report `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR`. Resizing the window doesn’t seem implemented on Wayland for now, but I wouldn’t expect it to cause any additional lag like it does on X11, it would just require changing the swapchain whenever the compositor requests a different window size, which I consider saner than introducing a frame of latency.    What do you mean by possibility 2 btw?  If we mark all drivers as not supporting `m_wm_reports_flag`, there should be exactly no frame of latency on any of the drivers, and it would also simplify the code quite a bit.|2019-10-22 11:56:11|linkmauve

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6829|2019-10-22 10:39:38|2019-10-23 09:19:47|Relying on the GUI is not good, we have already changed the GUI platform once before and it was a pain. We only use if for OGL because setting up wgl is not pretty, but vulkan is very flexible and handling the contexts ourselves makes things like headless rendering possible (rendering without a window is actually supported and implemented).    So here comes another problem: there is no "hey I'm about to resize" signal that is cross-platform. I already went through all this about a year ago, you can see the history of the gs_frame.cpp file for the win32 message queue hooks I had to set up to see windowing information before it could reach the drivers. However, driver bugs led to horrible situations including windows dying, unclosable windows processes and BSOD, so I would very much like to never go back to that. The way normal games deal with this is that you do not resize the window manually, it is driven from menus so the game already has the knowledge. There is no random user dragging the window border around in that case, which greatly simplifies what needs to be handled.|2019-10-22 18:52:30|kd-11

I’d welcome testing on radv to make sure it doesn’t regress any on Wayland, but it can’t be worse than no resizing of the buffer at all.    It seems to have also fixed resizing the windowed surface on Wayland, which behaves perfectly with no visible frame of latency and the buffer adopting the new swapchain size immediately!|2019-10-23 08:14:09|linkmauve

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6829|2019-10-22 10:39:38|2019-10-23 09:19:47|Ok, this system doesn’t seem to work on Linux at all, or at least not the way you describe it. Do I understand correctly that atm on Windows when you resize the window the buffer will continue to be at the previous size until you release the mouse button, at which point and only then the swapchain will get recreated at the size of the new buffer?  Because that’s totally not how I see it on either X11 or Wayland.    Maybe a better solution would be to keep the one frame delay on Windows, and to use the latency-less version on Linux?|2019-10-22 14:38:02|linkmauve
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6829|2019-10-22 10:39:38|2019-10-23 09:19:47|Yes and no. On windows, resizing will invalidate the swapchain but its rate is not as bad as actually resizing every 'tick'. Ofc on windows only NVIDIA has this implemented that I can test, I do not have access to a suitable intel IGP to confirm how it behaves on that platform. AMD does not have any swapchain status reports at all on windows. Sounds like we're going out of our way to try and appease the nvidia driver as much as possible because we are; that driver has caused me endless frustration in the past when it comes to swapchains.|2019-10-22 16:29:49|kd-11

Imo the best solution forward would be to make the Qt window layer propagate the size changes when it wants to change it (so that your Windows way continues to work, and on better windowing systems we can have the zero latency way), with e.g. an event sent to `GSRender` to recreate the swapchain.    What about the suggestion I gave in #6835 to use `QOpenGLWindow` and `QVulkanWindow` as the base class to avoid any kind of platform-specific context/WSI creation?

It does, but again only addresses one issue while there may be more. That said, it may be worth it making it create the path recursively regardless of my change.        > Just call Emu.Init after VFS dialog changes (with condition if emu status is Stopped).    I guess I can do that - I didn't do that initially to avoid possible side effects. I'll look into it.

MGS4 creates file `/dev_hdd1/cache/s/dev_hdd1/cache/s/gclvar.bak` (after failing once, it mkdirs and tries again then succeeds)  2. MGS4 launches MGS1 self (mgs/stage/module/en.self) as new program  3. You play through MGS1 self (created gclvar.bak file is still there and accessible)  4. MGS1 launches MGS4.self back again (with some args telling it to use gclvar.bak)  5. ---- /dev_hdd1/cache/ FOLDER IS CLEARED ---- (why ? we never switched games, only exes)  6. MGS4 fails to open `/dev_hdd1/cache/s/dev_hdd1/cache/s/gclvar.bak` (fs_open returning CELL_ENOENT) because cache was cleared, and proceeds to play as if you launched it normally (unable to progress).

I will give it a try and report the results back.    @Nekotekina You are right. timerfd does not support signalling. The thread will block during execution of the sleeps. For that reason I only implemented waits for small intervals. I'm totally fine if we reduce the maximum sleep time from 1000us to lets say 250us or even down to 100us. This is essentially the time interval the optimization aims for. |2019-10-04 06:08:29|plappermaul

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6697|2019-10-03 17:39:48|2019-10-09 17:03:35|Seems that at idle the accuracy is approx 16us, but if switch to the performance governor the accuracy is 10us. Since the load of RPCS3 will cause any system to raise to maximum power state, it makes sense to test the accuracy of this at maximum power state as well.     So I suggest simply setting the min quantum to 10us rather than 16, this will also have the benefit of "fixing" the behavior when the accuracy is set to usleep for values of 30us, since   `thread_ctrl::wait_for(remaining - ((remaining % host_min_quantum) + host_min_quantum));`  would evaluate to 0 for values of 30us, causing us to simply spin, and not take advantage of timerfd.|2019-10-04 14:36:42|Whatcookie

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6596|2019-09-21 00:11:14|2019-12-10 22:20:14|This morning, I made some tests with all the railshooters I know on ps3.  Results:    *Deadstorm pirates (NPEB00409):  Combined with a pad configured, I'm able to enter the menus (for example, I press the Circle on my controller to avoid connecting to Playstation Network), do the calibration and enter the mode selection (pressing circle).  The mouse is recognized as "Calibrate Motion Controller n°7"  When in full screen, I can't see the mouse pointer, so I can't calibrate.  When the window is maximized, it's working well. Whell I'm in fullscreen, I must make big moves with the mouse to move the crosshair. I tried to increase "mouse acceleration" to 20 and deadzone to 0, but it didn't change anything. The crosshair moves slowly when in fullscreen. I'm on a 4k screen (don't know if that's relevant).  The game plays nicely (remember to active "write color buffers").    *Mad dog mccree: calibration ok, no slowdown in fullscreen. I'm able to reload the gun in fullscreen by firing outside the screen. Pb: Game freezes while in the main street.   *Maddog 2 & The last bounty hunter: same behaviour.  *Fast Draw showdown: can't calibrate (the crosshair stays on the left side). Strange as it seems the same engine as MadDog.    *Heavyfire: afghanistan: stuck on "select profile-player 2"  *Heavyfire: shattered spea: stuck on "select profile-player 2"    *Men In Black: alien crisis: can't navigate the menus with the pad. I'm able to launch a game, but it asks to press L1 which I can't.    *House of the Dead 3: very similar to Deadstorm pirates: calibration ok, but cursor very slow in fullscreen. Reload is automatic. With Vulkan: poor performance and exploding vertices. With Ogl: ok. It played nicely with window maximized until the mouse stopped controlling the crosshair (the game was still playing, but I had no control)    *House of the Dead 4: looks like hotd3: performance is much better in Ogl. Pb is you can't reload (you need to shake the gun for that).    *House of the dead overkill: for the calibration, I can fire with the Middle click (X button), not the left one. The control works until I launch a minigame: it stops responding then. tried with and without WCB: no change.    *the shoot: can't calibrate    *time crisis: razing storm: can use the mouse and a pad to navigate the options. Crosshair speed is good in windowed and fullscreen. I can play the game (reload with the right button). It played nicely until the mouse stopped controlling the crosshair (the game was still playing, but I had no control).    *time crisis 4 BLUS30093: mouse not recognized.    *resident evil darkside chronicles: it loops on the calibration screen.

Thing is: it randomly stops considerig the mouse after a while: the game is still running, but the cursor doesn't answer to the mouse anymore.  Same behaviour in Razing storm.

It allowed me to see a bit of Maddog for the 1st time: the haircross moves, I can shoot. If I'm in Fullscreen, I can reload by firing outside the screen.  Unfortunately, after some time, either:  *the game freezes (it's still on, but you can't go to the next sequence)  *the mouse stops controlling the haircross (and the firing)  But it looks like it's the most playable for now (compared to other railshooter games)  ![Capture_067](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/65383416-97a90900-dd15-11e9-950f-32782d6131ba.jpg)  A few other tests:   *Hotd4: can't reload, so the game ends quite quickly.  *Hotd overkill: by middle clicking, I can get past the calibration and launch a mini-game.

Some games reload by shaking like house of dead 4 and on hod4, some parts of the levels can't even be progressed without shaking.    So there has to be a way to assign keyboard and mouse buttons for Psmove.    Lmb= Trigger= Shoot  Rmb= Shake = Reload/   Aim outside and shoot= Reload    And so on.    Without the ability to emualte Psmove shaking and assign the buttons, it's gonna be very limited. However, very good progress.

So the stuttering occurs for change in resolution?   I can't see my mouse cursor in fullscreen though, so I can't calibrate in fullscreen.

Unfortunately, the US version is unplayable as it needs Triangle mapping for calibration and it won't let you play unless calibrated.     Is there anyway to map Triangle to something else or allow keyboard mapping in addition? Maybe a setting in the config file even? Could you post a build maybe with Triangle instead of X button for further testing in the meantime?    ![2019-09-24 08_20_34-FPS_ 60 03 _ Vulkan _ 0 0 7-e0b90b7c-psmove-mouse _ TIME CRISIS_ RAZING STORM  B](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20983844/65526093-5a738100-dea5-11e9-990c-3dadc94dec18.png)    ![2019-09-24 08_23_47-Pull Requests · RPCS3_rpcs3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20983844/65526100-5c3d4480-dea5-11e9-8f88-4836b7eaafd7.png)    |2019-09-24 15:29:58|legend800

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6497|2019-09-08 07:05:56|2019-09-08 07:06:17|Thanks Megamouse! Works so much better now!     I would say x35-40 might be a perfect max, as at x30, it's like 90% of the cursor movement you'd expect, but it's ok. Does pc mouse speed factor into this?     Also, unrelated (sorry), but any chance of mapping ps pad 'shake' movement to a button or something? If so, I can submit a feature request. In games like HOTD4, you need to shake the pad to shake off enemies. Works fine in rpcs3 with a ps4 pad, but no way to do that with keyboard and mouse input currently. |2019-09-08 18:53:55|legend800

That's why 10x was already overkill in my opinion, since most mice support their own multipliers.    - There is no need for that feature request. This problem is already well known and there exist experimental versions. But it's not that simple, that's why you can't use it yet.|2019-09-08 18:58:00|Megamouse

While the second is hard to make it work due to the windows opening before the game, solved fullscreen with an hotkey script:  WinWait, FPS:  Send !{enter}  PS: I know there's an option to do that in the config menu, this is for who (like me) wants a different behaviour of all the emulators launched from the desktop rather than Bigbox without changing config file every time.|2019-11-24 03:47:16|miho171

AHK's implementation with BB is helpful in so many ways, but alas - still stuck with the GUI until such a time this is fixed.   beggars cant be choosers/patience is a virtue n all that :P    I "think" that setting the "hide all windows not in fullscreen mode" within launchbox will actually hide it, but it creates a bunch of other issues for me. |2019-11-24 13:39:09|klepp0906

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6407|2019-08-25 07:43:20|2019-08-31 15:08:05|little clarification on this guys if possible.    I have been using RPCS3 with several frontends and its one of the few to present issues as far as refinement goes due to being presented with the UI prior to the game actually loading.   (not a concern if playing at the pc, but when setting up a frontend to couch game its undesirable).    Now launchbox has several means to work around this, and in most cases (including rpcs3) they are adequate - when at the pc.    When streaming over steam, steam captures whatever is there. Hiding it is impossible.   Ive gone so far as moving the render window and GUI window to separate displays and steams capture method still loves to grab the GUI window first.    The one guaranteed way around this, which ive been watching and waiting for - is a CLI means of launching directly and circumventing the gui.   I had assumed this is what `--no-gui` was intended to do.    After a bit of testing, and now reading through the relevant issues on github, it seems it isnt intended to, or doesnt function that way?  Is that correct?    I'm basically using `rpcs3.exe --no-gui "FULL\PATH\TO\ROM\FILE"` which results in rpcs3 quickly opening and closing it looks like, or simply opening the GUI and no game (presumably running invis)    So if it does not function as I'm assuming, is it possible that we get a command line switch for the aforementioned, and perhaps if your feeling really generous, one for --fullscreen so fullscreen can be forced if playing remote without having to resort to toggling the gui option on/off beforehand. |2019-10-12 19:01:58|klepp0906

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6407|2019-08-25 07:43:20|2019-08-31 15:08:05|The problem is that we haven't properly implemented the no-gui option yet. So if you run a game with llvm recompilers then it will open a window with a progress bar. As soon as that window is completed the game will close itself. You can work around this issue if you use interpreters and asmjit. This is a known issue. So it it basically working "as intended" for now. |2019-10-12 23:01:44|Megamouse

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6359|2019-08-16 17:17:13|2019-09-12 20:32:22|Yes, its caused by SPU post-processing. I did some initial investigation into it and found the code that does it, but I couldn't figure out what exactly it was trying to do. I think blur has the same issue, it makes sense to try and tackle that game as it is simpler and has a PC port to compare to. It also doesn't hang anytime I try to debug something so it should be a nicer experience overall.

For this game Approximate FCGT and FNMS instructios must always be ON, otherwise the game will crash, the only instruction that has visual affect on this game is FMA, so here's the difference  Inaccurate FMA: has colored pixels artifacts (which is actually old regression, can't find myselw what caused it), girl's hair missing, and game crashes on first gunshot or if girl pick ups the cell phone, the reason i guess in some effect that called Omni/nonshadow light in U2 Debug menu, i think it interferes. But the main thing: aside all of these bugs the screen is clear, black squareas are not presented.  ![34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7060586/64955524-2094f000-d891-11e9-873a-b3a35b18e4b6.jpg)  Approximate FMA: also can have colored pixels by itself (which is fixed if combined with Approximate FM) girl's hair is working, no crashes on gunshots, but here's the well known black squared artifacts.  ![36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7060586/64955385-c6942a80-d890-11e9-9eac-66aa522ee400.jpg)  Accurate FMA: the instruction not work by itself, requires at least Approximate FM to be in pair with, otherwise crashes, but visuals are clear, everything works, no crashes, yet has a major performance impact.  ![33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7060586/64955648-75386b00-d891-11e9-917e-f1fbc80f2b12.jpg)  My verdict from all of this: smth is wrong with Approximate FMA, it would be great if it gains a little bit more accuracy.  |2019-09-16 11:52:36|Xcedf

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/6272|2019-07-27 14:37:21|2019-10-23 22:26:08|So it's likely the reason both this and code in current master can be creashy is because GUI update calls are invoked from outside the GUI thread - and it's possible that this PR makes it "worse" because it's invoking those concurrently and not from just one "trophy update thread", like it is now.    With `QT_FATAL_WARNINGS` it is easy to spot which calls throw errors, although you may have to reconvert some `ICON0.PNG` images to RGB colour profile to avoid a now-critical `iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile` warnings.    I am currently experimenting with `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`, which hopefully will execute those Qt calls on a correct GUI thread. I am getting somewhere, but looks like there is a ton of places which have to be delegated to a separate thread and that may eventually break code relying on order of execution of Qt widget updates.|2019-08-10 20:59:26|CookiePLMonster

I wouldn't do this until neko implements the interpreter fallback path, simply because of the initial spu module compilations people will encounter runtime.

You could argue that that issue was largely improved by the multithreaded SPU module compilation, and about that I'd agree. But overall, the initial stutters are still insufferable on systems that are not yahfz's 8700K@5.3GHz, like mine.    Running P5 with SPU LLVM and cleared cache locks up the game for me before reaching the menu even. I have to give it 2-3 goes before an initial cache is finally compiled, and the game doesn't yeet itself.|2019-07-12 11:58:13|dio-gh

I'd need to see a comparison with old builds but RSX captures are not working on old builds which means one has to use RDC to compare. Provide RDC of the old builds with reflections to compare against current.  EDIT: What I mean the reflections have nothing - they have a few lights rendered but they look very strange like thin lines instead of big lights. That is what GT engine uses for fake reflections in all games, but it seems to work fine in other games for some reason.|2019-07-08 19:04:54|kd-11

VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive  Gives applications explicit control over exclusive full-screen modes (this is for instance useful for HDR support).

Historically speaking, no code for the amdgpu target has ever been backported for a maintenance release (i.e. the recent llvm 8.0.1), and there also hasn't been any continued fixes/updates once the release has been forked for the Release Candidate stage.  So unless distros manually backport the fix, very few people will get it before 9.0.    I don't think it's too reasonable to expect people to run experimental drivers.  As LLVM 9 won't be released for at least another 2 full months, it would be a good idea to at least print a warning about this being a known issue with LLVM 8.0, and to direct them to the OpenGL renderer in the meantime if they're experiencing issues.|2019-06-24 23:44:57|Hirato

Besides though, this won't change behavior for games requesting sleeps that small anyways, since we still don't sleep for values that small.

The windows code is inaccurate for values above 500 us, and the linux code on master is inaccurate for values above 100 us.     You can see in the results I posted above, while 100us works fine on master, just 200us suddenly causes linux to sleep for 281us. Even such small values can be wildly inaccurate on master.    That being said, while I don't expect any negative effects other than ~2% higher cpu usage seen in the overlay, I haven't found any games that respond positively to the added accuracy. So there's certainly no rush to get this merged.    I'll test this on my computer with hypthreading disabled later and see how bad it is 4T cpus, but testing from people with other usleep sensitive games would be nice.     If this method is really determined too expensive for 4T cpus (I doubt it), then I have another commit that I can push that I was playing around with earlier that should make usleep about 50% more accurate on linux (without spending any extra time yielding). |2019-06-16 02:01:07|Whatcookie

Demon souls seems to have an issue on this pr with TSX enabled:   ![flicker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26352541/59324004-16b88b00-8cab-11e9-9dc9-959b04e9b1be.png)  geometry now flickers in and out in certain scenes.   I tested 92ec6ab7c3d83061e6dda04ae4a8cae8a9b14306 as well (last commit before performance improvement) and its still occurring there.     The flickering occurs every frame, and in a much more intense way after writing 1 to force_abort msr, so perhaps an issue with the fallback?  ![flicker2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26352541/59324305-5469e380-8cac-11e9-84c7-9865b602662e.png)  |2019-06-12 05:04:57|Whatcookie

P5 works great but now I tested a number of other games and I notice several games that used to work with SPU LLVM Mega, no longer work if TSX is enabled after this PR was merged.     For example, MotorStorm 2 worked great with SPU LLVM Mega and TSX before this PR, but now it freezes before every race if TSX is _enabled_.  But if I switch to LLVM Safe and TSX _enabled_, it works but slower since that game runs better with Mega. Also, SPU LLVM Mega and TSX _disabled_ works.    Not sure if this is due to Haswell TSX or if others are experiencing it. Hopefully some other Haswell TSX users can test and confirm or maybe @Nekotekina can take a 2nd look at it. I can post a log if necessary. Using Windows10.|2019-05-23 09:27:30|incognitoh

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5982|2019-05-17 10:09:28|2019-05-17 20:43:01|Yes, this is basically an automated version of the thread pausing hack that is often used for Persona 5.    I'm not an expert on this topic, but from what I've understood Spurs is a multithreading library that developers use to assign tasks for SPUs to execute without having to write the threading code themselves. This option limits the amount of threads for these     The upside is that there's less chances for resource contention, less context switching on thread-limited CPUs and hopefully less time wasted on synchronizing the threads, The downside is that games were never intended to be ran with limited thread count and thus all kinds of issues could arise.|2019-05-17 18:15:27|MSuih

Besides, it'd require some other modifications to CPU tab to make room for a dropdown menu there and I'm not sure what megamouse would think of it. Either way, if you guys want to seriously suggest it then I'd recommend starting a new issue for it.    @Zangetsu38 Yes, but only values between 1-5 activate the limiter code, 6 causes it to be skipped. So technically the game code could spawn more threads, not that it would make any sense. Besides, I think it looks better this way.    https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/blob/ea554ae8285e18d4ab4dcbded9ef1b94c78f9021/rpcs3/Emu/Cell/lv2/sys_spu.cpp#L260|2019-05-20 01:02:08|MSuih

As said above, it was very helpful on Windows 7, where SPU Thread scheduler not seems to work normally, especially on 4-core CPUs, where it caused constant random freezes. Maybe it would be even nice to expand SPURS thread managing with adding Automatic mode, based on CPU threads count.

That'll clean up another few hundred errors.    If anyone with knowledge about some of the remaining rpcs3 warnings (@elad335 @Nekotekina maybe?) and think of a way to resolve them, I can put those changes here too. The problem is that those instructions are wrapped in macros that disable them for missing instruction sets. However the macros are just left blank, generating a warning. For example, after the preprocessor is run, we get code like the following  `const auto sa = (A, index);`    which is just weird|2019-05-14 23:23:14|JohnHolmesII
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5964|2019-05-14 19:49:15|2019-06-27 23:05:44|I've gone ahead and implemented the changes to silence 3rd party code. I put in some PoC workarounds for the macro issues; these changes may or may not be okay.    Currently, the clang travis build produces no warnings of any kind. The log has gone from 8665 lines to 1220.    I still have more plans. Neko recently turned on extra warnings (-Wall) for gcc that was not turned on for clang. I plan to unify the flags between the 2 compilers, since they are mostly compatible. I will try to get as close to exact -Wall compliance as I can in future commits. Perhaps even -Wextra if enough gets done. Hopefully we can maintain this into the future.|2019-05-15 07:48:22|JohnHolmesII

Not only does it let errors through but it now also spams `cl : Command line warning D9025 : overriding '/w' with '/W4'` for every single compiled LLVM file and similar erros for some other 3rdparty stuff. My setup is a bit unusual though, I don't expect full support for it.    I can upload the whole compile output somewhere if you're interested in wading through it.|2019-05-15 12:41:04|MSuih

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5964|2019-05-14 19:49:15|2019-06-27 23:05:44|I've pushed an update with quite a bit of changes to what's going on. When adding -Wall to the compilers, many more warnings were exposed. It was both too many for me to handle, and also well outside my knowledge to fix. So while refactoring the cmake setup to be (hopefully) more clear than it was before, I decided to simply enumerate all the warnings as silenced, rather than not use -Wall.    This may seem odd (and that list is disturbingly long), but it provides a number of advantages. For one, the sight of it may encourage devs to begin working on them. For another, the log output is much cleaner, meaning that *new* PRs will have new warnings immediately highlighted for all to see, **preventing issues from creeping in**.    It also provides a neat little way for contributors to help the issue, as this is larger than one dev can handle. Simply pop a warning off the silenced list, repair the necessary code until it is fixed, then open a PR. Recently several PRs were introduced that had small warning-fix scope, and hopefully we can get more of those.    I still have plans here.  1) GCC has an old issue rearing its head, #1818. It seems to have come back either in recent GCCs, or because I'm an idiot, or both. Before there was a warning silence in place (-Wno-invalid-pch), but readding this doesn't seem to help, likely because it is simply in the wrong place. It might be easier to fix than it looks, so I will look into that first.  2) MSVC has not been worked on at all, and I will have to do that. I have a wild fantasy that we might switch the windows build to clang and I won't have to do any work, but I cannot rely on that, given the "inertia" of the project.  3) Find a way to slap on -Werror. This will be useful as new PRs will *clearly* have warnings marked by CI, and it can't slip past reviewers who might be focused elsewhere.    And of course, I will be addressing the other review comments.|2019-06-07 08:27:53|JohnHolmesII

That may be why GCC takes so much longer to build. I tried to look into it, but I get a different error than what is seen on travis. Someone with knowledge of cotire needs to take a look. Also, GCC is giving "notes", which seemingly can't be turned off, as they aren't even warnings. The changes required to fix the note spam is best handled by someone with knowledge of the objects.

But actually most of the offset originates in the font and not the circle itself.  And btw, I actually didn't even try to improve the circles in the game grid...  But ironically they will look a lot better with higher pixel ratios as a side effect of my game icon commit.    @MSuih I won't be using qreal for now since I have already exhausted my patience with these changes and I don't wanna test it anymore XD.  Also, the icons look a lot better in any configuration I tested and tbh I never really noticed it before Daginatsuko pointed it out.... so I guess this would be a very minor nitpick if someone notices anything at all.|2019-05-04 18:50:25|Megamouse

Seems like Qt draws the graphics first and then scales them for DPI, which means that applying antialiasing to the draw operation will just make it look worse.    Does the same issue affect grid mode as well? The compatibility circles can be enabled with `View -> Show Game Compatibility in Grid Mode`. Squares would probably look even worse in grid mode though.|2019-05-01 05:27:54|MSuih

I know they both use hid-sony kernel module    But for example I know when connecting through bluetooth, the PS3 controller actually requires a special Bluez plugin in userspace, and an extra authorization prompt in bluetoothctl, whereas PS4 controllers through bluetooth don't need a plugin, or authorization prompt.    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/plugins/sixaxis.c    Point being I think the PS3 controller is funky.    You would know much more than me on what a PS3 controller does though. I found this github issue with a response from the hidapi developer on PS3 controllers https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/issues/74    Btw you can compile hidapi programs with `-lhidapi-hidraw` or `-lhidapi-libusb`, libusb didn't work.

I'll look into the solution file once I have some time, that should get it to work for most people.    As for the PEB stuff, I still prefer my current implementation over that.

Vulkan vs master should be enough.  The differences between OpenGL and Vulkan in some cases is because OpenGL supports float16 'natively'. In reality most vulkan drivers also do support float16 but they do not advertise this feature properly. The differences appear when the native float16 implementation is more accurate than the one we emulate with the shader. A config option "disable native float16 support" exists in config.yml to force use of the shader emulation path and should also 'break' OpenGL when enabled.|2019-04-20 10:34:39|kd-11

Every test I have run on real hw says they should be black spots there (because the programmer forgot to add a saturate modifier somewhere, literally one misssing bit). Obviously the real PS3 somehow does not generate the condition that would require this, so I'm not sure if its a real regression. Its easy to add the saturate for them but this would be a hack.

It no longer behaves like real hardware but we cannot match exactly the PS3's TMU so I think going out of spec there is fine. Basically the texture filtering does not seem to match the PS3 exactly pixel-for-pixel which is expected. Since texturing is completely fixed function (non-programmable) a workaround is the only way to get around this. I can make the hotspots dance around the screen by altering the filtering even very slightly causes the hotspots to migrate. More research on this topic will be carried out at a later date, but likely only for academic curiosity rather than improving any games (NaNs are rather useless as they are often substituted with 0 anyway).|2019-04-23 15:05:07|kd-11

Yes, a lot of CPUs apply a negative AVX offset, but a lot of people will set this offset to 0, and it's a waste to remove AVX when there is no offset. In addition, AVX is used in various critical regions (e.g. TSX code), and even with throttling it should still be faster than not having AVX at all. Or are there benchmarks showing otherwise?    You mention "context switch cost" - what context switch cost are you specifically referring to? Do you mean the need to stack/unstack the AVX registers? Won't they end up being stacked anyway even if unused?    If this gets merged, I would definitely be against a permanent disable - it needs to be exposed as a yaml config option *at least*.|2019-04-15 14:15:52|ruipin

Also, what do you mean by "SPU ASMJIT doesn't emit code which makes real use of 256 bit wide instructions"? As far as I understand, the TSX path emits AVX2 code on both ASMJIT and LLVM (since the logic is shared). Why does it matter if SPU ASMJIT doesn't otherwise?    Or are you proposing splitting the TSX path for ASMJIT and LLVM, and making ASMJIT only not use AVX? Then I can somewhat understand the logic, but I very much doubt most high-end Intel cores will even care - most of them will have an AVX offset of 0. And since TSX is present only on high-end cores, if feels like you're optimizing the TSX path for CPUs that don't have TSX? :thinking:    I concede that "disabling AVX completely" is incorrect, I should have said "disabling AVX in the TSX path".    Anyway, will wait for benchmarks. But I'd be very surprised if this improved performance, especially on high-end CPUs. I'm expecting the opposite, in fact, since this effectively doubles the number of instructions in the TSX critical region.|2019-04-15 15:01:39|ruipin

PS3-compatible Fanatec wheels like the Porsche GT2/3v2, CSR/Elite, and CSWv1 have a "PS3 Mode" which emulates a G25 or G27 depending on the firmware version, so they will probably work.

Which imo makes more sense.  I'll add separators to indicate the distinction but there is a bit more work to do on the skylanders manager anyway(the skylanders generated won't work on giant and spyro because they don't include a recovery mode), I might also include extra stuff like money/xp editor).    edit:  Nvm the ID order is not completely the release order it seems but I still think sorting per game would be the best option.|2019-04-25 07:56:32|RipleyTom

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5680|2019-02-22 11:43:11|2019-02-27 19:16:10|I did more reverse engineering for this syscall, turns out this syscall uses unique unlocking flags as opposed to `sys_lwmutex_unlock`.  The unlocking flags are being ORed in both syscall 117 and `sys_lwmutex_unlock`.  Any of those flags is enough for sys_lwmutex_lock to acquire the lock, and clears the flags.  When only the flag of syscall 117 is used, the return value of `sys_lwmutex_lock` is EBUSY.  `sys_lwmutex_trylock` on the other hand, accepts only the flag from `sys_lwmutex_unlock`, but clears both on success.

The old way worked because it was so broken that the wrong data was getting to the GPU. Rolling back the commits and enforcing strict memory management rules shows the same issues on master. Most of the noted regressions simply disappear when using WCB+CPU blit for this reason.  As such, this PR will be merged as-is for now and a follow-up PR will be done to address the missing features.|2019-03-09 11:22:27|kd-11

It's cubersome to move the cursor to that button every time one wants to erase something. Space as a button woudn't be too bad of an idea either. In addition I think the PS3 OSK also allows you to move the caret around, you could consider implementing that with shoulder buttons as well.    Also I don't like having shift and accept/cancel as face buttons. A more natural spot for shift would be a shoulder button imo and start would be more fitting as an accept button. I'm not sure what to do with cancel though, maybe it could be placed on the keyboard with no button assigned to it.|2019-01-30 06:31:15|MSuih

The removal functions are very dumb, they just recursevily iterate the directory and remove files ending with ".obj" or ".dat", or a folder named "shaders_cache". They don't care about cache versions or anything like that, all they need is to get pointed at the right directory.    @Kravickas I'll try to keep the scope of this pull request as small as possible so that it can be quickly merged. Megamouse has open PR for some misc improvements, you could do feature requests there.    @JohnHolmesII I looked at it and I've no idea why it doesnt work.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5457|2018-12-26 01:40:58|2018-12-30 14:58:22|Ok, the function used to determine if it's a valid resolution is at(in vsh of firmware 4.83): 0x000C6B18(r5=res and r6=aspect). Of note in that function is a call to 000C56F4 with r3=res and r4=?(seems to be 2 or changed according to some internal vsh setting). I think this function converts the resolution from config to an internal resolution value.  If you follow the path with res=0 it's nearly the same as res=4(there is a check that r4==2 in the res=4 path). But I think we can assume res 0 is res 4(CELL_VIDEO_OUT_RESOLUTION_480).

But once back in-game it recovers immediately for me (i9-9900k and i7-4770k, both also tested with 2 and 4 thread affinity).    Try increasing the buffer duration (to e.g. 125000 or 150000) or turn on time stretching.    And yes, if a game like Infamous can't manage (close to) full speed, it's unlikely buffering will help much, sadly.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5456|2018-12-25 18:12:52|2019-01-12 18:29:58|What CPU? I only see it happen immediately after a loading screen once or twice, usually the first loading screen (or when shader/SPU compilation causes stutter). In all those cases it's just the game's fault, causing the audio mixer SPU jobs to starve due to the large amount of SPU jobs right after the loading screen ends.    Again, try increasing the buffer duration (to e.g. 125000 or 150000) or turn on time stretching. Might help. Setting SPU threads to 2 or 1 also helps a lot with that game (frees up CPU time for audio).|2018-12-25 19:43:39|ruipin

Seeing this message last does **not** mean that audio is responsible for the crash. In fact, you will see this message every single time a game that was previously driving audio crashes.    To properly understand what caused a game to crash, look for what comes *before* this message (usually a Fatal message "F" in purple instead of Error "E" in red).|2019-01-16 20:55:02|ruipin

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5456|2018-12-25 18:12:52|2019-01-12 18:29:58|I don't personally use PulseAudio, but I know multiple people do (it's the default RPCS3 audio backend for linux IIRC), so I don't think implementing buffering support would be wasted time. It probably wouldn't be too much effort either - I just didn't do it because I had never used PA before and so was not familiar with the API. Stretching is less useful (other than for very rare corner cases), and I believe PA doesn't have built-in support for it so you probably shouldn't worry too much about that part.    Take a look at the abstract AudioBackend class, which has comments describing what the API expects:  https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/blob/master/rpcs3/Emu/Audio/AudioBackend.h    And then you can use OpenAL as reference:  https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/tree/master/rpcs3/Emu/Audio/AL    You'll want to implement the same methods with similar behaviour, and then report the capabilities accordingly, e.g.:  `static const u32 capabilities = PLAY_PAUSE_FLUSH   IS_PLAYING   GET_NUM_ENQUEUED_SAMPLES;`    I'm no longer active on the project, but let me know if you have any more questions.  |2019-09-01 13:54:44|ruipin

I was wondering what the capabilities meant, I guess it just means whatever optional stuff you implemented for that backend.    I'll try to get something working without bothering you then, thank you!    If it is easy enough, maybe I can do it to ALSA as well later, if it's there maybe something uses it.    Maybe it'll teach me enough to see if I can go with cubeb as well. I've already had a PR done on PulseAudio a year ago, but that's a long time, I don't remember anything anymore about either code base... |2019-09-01 18:56:26|John-Gee
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5456|2018-12-25 18:12:52|2019-01-12 18:29:58|Yes, the capabilities just represent sets of functionality that can optionally be implemented in the Backend.    By default (empty capability set reported), a backend simply gets fed audio data, and it plays audio until there's no more audio left. This is done by calling `AddData()`, as such every backend is *required* to implement `AddData()`. In this case, cellAudio does nothing special - as we get audio from the game, we feed it straight to the backend, and let it do its thing. This is essentially the current implementation of the PulseAudio backend.    More advanced backends might report the `PLAY_PAUSE_FLUSH` capability, meaning that they implement `Play()`, `Pause()` and `Flush()`. These methods allow more fine-grained control of audio playback, and if present cellAudio will be able to buffer data. For example, we request the backend be paused (using `Pause()`), we then feed in some data slowly, and then when the buffer is large enough we just call `Play()`. Strictly speaking, this is the only *necessary* capability for audio buffering, but there is no easy way of knowing whether a backend is currently playing or paused. As such, there is also the `IS_PLAYING` capability, which means the backend implements the `IsPlaying()` method. With these two capabilities, cellAudio will be able to provide audio buffering.     The reason why `PLAY_PAUSE_FLUSH` is separate from `IS_PLAYING` is because cellAudio can be slightly smarter about driving audio if only one of them is present - but you need both for audio buffering to work correctly.    However, without the `GET_NUM_ENQUEUED_SAMPLES` capability, controlling for a constant buffer size is more difficult. This capability means that the backend supports the `GetNumEnqueuedSamples()` call, which returns how many audio samples are left in the current buffer (i.e. how much audio there is left to play, assuming we stopped feeding in any new audio). Without this capability present, audio buffering is more prone to accidental buffer underflows / crackling, as it has to guess the current size of the buffer by keeping track of how many samples have been sent to the backend, and how much clock time has passed, which obviously isn't as accurate as being directly given this information by the backend. Turns out some audio APIs make it difficult to know how much audio is left in the buffer, so this capability is optional (but recommended).    Finally, there is the `SET_FREQUENCY_RATIO` capability, which describes that `SetFrequencyRatio()` is implemented. This is required to use the current time stretching functionality, hower time stretching is useful only in very rare corner case scenarios, so it's probably not worthwhile to implement it for backends where this isn't simply directly exposed from the API. OpenAL and XAudio both expose this, but AFAIK PulseAudio does not and would require manual software processing.|2019-09-01 19:07:12|ruipin

It will work as long as the CPU model reported by emulator contains the string "Intel". If you really want to test it then you can download the older version [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rpcs3/rpcs3/builds/21190722/artifacts).

The option won't probably have too much of an impact to performance (and it's limited to 2-cores with HT), but at least the option does something and there is a framework in case kd-11 or someone else improves the scheduler.

This doesn't mean that your concern is invalid, it just means that it's something I can't fix on my own.    I'll let the higher-ups figure out what to do with that. Thread scheduler just might not be a setting that Intel users should always keep enabled.    Edit: What I mean is that it's not a bug and actually expected behavior to some degree. Thread scheduler is not intended to always provide best performance, it's there as an option for those who are looking for ways to get extra performance out of their games and willing to experiment with things.|2018-12-22 13:32:52|MSuih

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5446|2018-12-21 13:44:43|2019-07-11 19:13:13|I added some code for using a Rocksmith USB cable with this PR. That cable acts as a mono microphone. The code is enough to get the game to recognize an attached guitar and to process input from it. Not sure if it entirely correct though since the game has a lot of audio output stutter (disabling framelimit and using Null renderer helps a bit).    There is one big hack in cellMicOpenEx, which Rocksmith 2014 calls with rawChannel=4. This value is ignored and hard set to 1 for mono input. Not sure what to make of this, maybe it is more like maxChannels in cellMicOpenRaw?

With all of the GPU Scaling, LLVM, 6 SPU threads, Mega size, SPU cache, fullscreen, 165Hz refresh rate [CRT], none framelimiter and "realtime" rpcs3 process priority [win7]    as of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 - with these fixes it's absolute stable fullspeed [on nightly builds there were slowdowns in rare cases of opponent customizations+selected stage].    Soulcalibur V went from 17-20fps with no_color_buffers to 29-34 with color-buffers. [on nightly build it was also a matter of luck to get into training mode. And with these fixes I master in practice mode and went through Arcade mode around ~10 times with no crash or freeze at all]  Soulcalibur IV is working too, and it's slightly smoother then Soulcalibur V with stage from Star Wars in Arcade mode showing almost 60 fps on any character.    Outrun 2006 is much smoother in heavy places too [with fire rings in forest for example]. Now it finally produces results smoother then pcsx2 [on the same hardware]    Dead or Alive 5 LR at first launched with freeze on character thumbnails [same as nighlty builds], and with second and next launches it was stable and just faster then nightly builds. With settings set to fight only on Dojo stage - speed is even higher then 100% [and I think it can be limited to desired speed through drivers limiter. Will try this only after some time\days]    Virtua Figher 5 FS is working good and probably consuming less energy by this fix [on nightly builds it worked already flawlessly]|2019-01-05 02:12:03|MokuDuk

The PR added a conditional lock optimization bearing in mind that games would not use this lock regularly.  The extensive use of the lock in this game made the heavy transactions use even slower which is why you are seeing the semaphore timeouts.  I've succeeded to reproduce this "crash" in master with TSX enabled + Accurate GETLLAR + PUTLLUC settings to make transactions slow enough.

To achieve this I've looped getllar on the same addr until the value of the data changed from the original, then checked the status of the events. even though the event was triggered on both the emulator and realhw, the cause is different: after detecting a data change im using getllar with a different address to lose previous reservation. so on realhw, the event is triggered by an external write, on the pr its triggered by "last even check" and on master its triggered by the execution of getllar with a different address from the current reservation.  |2018-12-22 20:29:55|elad335

RPCS3 keeps crashing whenever I try and RSX capture it. This bug is visible when looking towards fire effects (not explosions). Master builds have issues with how the fire itself is displayed and the fire flickers.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5367|2018-11-24 00:33:05|2018-12-16 15:17:22|Right, in fact there is one more issue. I wanted to address it in the beginning, but unfortunately failed to implement. I believe MoltenVK, despite not working as of now, is no less mature than gfx portability at the very least, and wanted to support them both.    My original idea is to weak link (`-weak_library`) to either but not include the file. Later on I dynamically loaded (`dlopen`) one of the libraries to solve the symbols. This works just fine in flat namespace mode (all symbols belong to global namespace), but at present Apple uses two-level namespace (each symbol belongs to some library namespace), which obviosly fails. I tried doing the binding myself, yet it did not work properly (I could start rpcs3 but it would crash later on null pointer exec). I believe this solution may be fixed to work, yet it remains very hacky and not reliable.    For this reason, the way to select the Vulkan implementation is fairly open. We could always patch/symlink the vulkan library within rpcs3.app itself, but it will break codesigning if it is considered.|2018-11-27 13:49:08|vit9696

This doesn't strike me as valid at all. The file will **always** remain in the git history. If mention bot is ever restored, and I would gladly bet money that it will never be re-added, then just pull it out of the repo. It's also trivial to make a new one.    In fact, it would be better to make a new one at that point, as there are more devs now that should be added (jarves, for one) that are currently not in there. If the team is insistent, then I will remove the commit. But I just want to add that there is no logic in keeping a loose file in the repo. My 2c.    >I'd like to keep the MacOS instructions as well    So would I. But I think a wiki page is better for that. I've never seen a dev either here or on discord who is using a mac for development, and it certainly isn't useful for end users right now. So I view the mac stuff in the same vein as freeBSD or msys build instructions: too rare to be of much value on the repos front page. It just gets in the way of *everyone else's* intructions.    >I think https://wiki.rpcs3.net might be a better place    A wonderful idea. I think they should be put wherever they are most accessible. But this pr can't write to the rpcs3 wiki page, so that will have to be done seperately. If I am allowed to edit the wiki, I will gladly organize that myself.|2018-12-03 23:36:12|JohnHolmesII

I'll take a look at this tomorrow and see if I can figure out what's causing it, but I fear I might've taken too big of a task here. I've done some multithreading work in the past but Qt seems more confusing in that regard than other frontend frameworks.    I've already spotted some other potential trouble spots, I'll return in a day or two to report how far my research got me.

But I'll look into your proposal. Setting volume beyond 100% can cause distortion or reduction in quality, but I guess that's up for user to decide.    @Hirato Yes, the actual volume changes woudn't be too hard to implement. The problem is that RPCS3 uses a simplified version of the PulseAudio API that has just enough functionality to play audio and pretty much nothing else.

Worked perfectly fine on previous build (7411), as it had for a long time. On 7412, if there's SPU cache it'll crash whole emu. If you clear that, the emu will fully crash upon showing gameplay.     Now I can see this PR is just a GUI thing, but I'm only reporting the facts (triple checked).

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5117|2018-09-12 11:19:04|2018-09-13 09:43:42|Thank you @MSuih, I have also confirmed your findings. That helped figure out why there were performance gains; it was because zcull testing was illegally disabled.  @scribam   WRT the changes in check_zcull_status.  Picture the following:  1. The game changes the current depth buffer to some memory that is linked to the ZCULL unit. Zcull statistics are not enabled so no testing is expected. Your optimization aborts early and no ZCULL usage takes place.  2. The game enables Zcull testing. There is no framebuffer swapped however, so the set_active call now fails since zcull_surface_active was never updated and remains forever false.    EDIT: It is common for a game to enable and disable occlusion reports several times while rendering to the same framebuffer, even when it is bound to ZCULL ram. In fact, the framebuffer_swap path is very rarely taken in the context of a frame; usually about a dozen times at most for the highest end AAA games. Some rare cases can go above that but not by much since changing ROP target is quite expensive on GPU hardware (it messes with their memory controller caches)|2018-09-12 17:36:47|kd-11

Their game engine seems to rely on mapping/unmapping pages very often, and so need this PR to get past the first loading screen before the main menu.    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11169970/45728987-6b1e5680-bbc2-11e8-919d-de8ba0c49e7b.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11169970/45729000-6fe30a80-bbc2-11e8-9979-461973f6242f.png)  |2018-09-19 03:10:45|ruipin

Having it enabled makes that game freeze as soon as level is selected, but when it's unchecked levels load just fine. Not a huge issue since GPU scaling barely has any impact on performance, but a regression nonetheless.    RDR now works as well as it does on master, but keeps spamming the following in console for some reason:   ```  U {rsx::thread} RSX TODO: Flushable section 0xc0384000 data may have been lost (lock_memory_region)  U {rsx::thread} RSX TODO: Valid region data may have been incorrectly unprotected (0xc0384000-0xc0707fff)  U {rsx::thread} RSX TODO: Flushable section 0xc0000000 data may have been lost (lock_memory_region)  U {rsx::thread} RSX TODO: Valid region data may have been incorrectly unprotected (0xc0000000-0xc0383fff)  ```  It's probably an older bug that's just never had console output before, but I'll attach [a log file](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/files/2397456/RPCS3.log.gz) regardless.

I believe kd's latest PR has a fix for that bug.    As for THPS HD, that explains a lot. GPU Texture Scaling should never be used, so I didn't actually test it. Sometimes I wonder why it's not simply removed from the menu, but yeah. I'll take a look and see if I can reproduce the regression.    @stride21   Hmm, that is an interesting one. I think I know what the issue is, but will have to confirm. I have TLOU, so can take a look. Provide a log if possible. What options do you have enabled?

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5115|2018-09-11 23:41:08|2018-09-24 12:26:42|I have fixed three(!) more causes of the VirtualProtect errors. Two of these were actually bugs in master that could cause softlocks/hangs/crashes but one of my changes made them fail immediately (one particular game that showed a lot of these issues was GoW3). Note that the current fix is somewhat experimental, so I would appreciate if people could test it a bit on GoW3 (and other games).  (especially @elhaya since you saw all the juicy `VirtualProtect` failures so far).    One of these fixes (a stupid typo in a very important function) seems to have fixed the THPS HD deadlock reported above as well. Please retest.    I did not manage to reproduce the `Assertion failed: !region.is_locked() && region.is_dirty()` assertion in TLOU. It is likely fixing that typo has also fixed this, but please retest and let me know. Otherwise I'll try again tomorrow.    -----------------------------    For a quick and dirty explanation of what was causing the GoW3 VirtualProtect failures, and likely some of the deadlocks experienced in that game on master, I'm going to quote my explanation on Discord:      > basically, there was a flushable section that spanned multiple cell pages (i.e. 0x3500'0000 to 0x37f00'0000)  > the game then decides to unmap one single cell block in the middle of that range (e.g. 0x3550'0000 through 0x355F'FFFF)  > the section is now invalid, obviously  > let's imagine the section was recently being used  > and nothing triggered a read/write to its address space between the last use and the unmap  > it is a flushable, so is locked no-access  > once someone faults, the violation handler unlocks and flushes  > (note: the only unusual thing the game does is the large section and the unmap in the middle)  > when the game unmaps, it triggers the notify_memory_unmapped callback on the RSX thread  > once the notify_memory_unmapped callback triggers  > the RSX saw the section as being in the unmapped range  > and discarded it  > it basically threw it away, thinking there's no sense in keeping it around so it is in unmapped memory  > HOWEVER large parts of it were locked no-access in memory that did NOT get unmapped  > meaning we just left the whole address space from e.g. 0x3500'0000 through 0x354F'FFFF locked NA without any valid section information structure to keep track of that  > anytime a game tries to access that address space, it will enter the RSX violation handler  > then sees that there's no section in this address space, but it has been cached in the past  > replies "This was a region of memory that we used to handle, but it's empty now (even though we didn't do anything since nothing matched)"  > the violation handler returns to the game  > the game retries the same access  > violation handler fires again  > ...  > = softlock|2018-09-20 02:13:00|ruipin

As for the second assertion, that assertion covers a corner case bug (that exists on master) that I actually had a hunch could trigger but never saw trigger (that was why I added the assertion). I will need to discuss it with @kd-11 to see if that's an easy fix. Potentially I'll change that assertion to a TODO log message and work on fixing it on a different PR. This one is starting to drag on for more than I'd like and it's starting to get unwieldy (and it's also blocking kd's PR from getting merged).

For now, I have decided to revert kd's PR and then rebase his commits on top of mine (which is much easier than rebasing mine on top of his) - effectively as if he merged after me. This means rebasing on top of master as master advances is easy, and a straight line history is kept. Alternatively, I can do a merge commit before the merge to master, if prefered.

This might be related to the flashing in DeS with WCB on that is also present on master. I can reproduce that one and yes, it is slightly affected by this PR, but I believe it is due to different timings.    Did find another bug/issue but that one is present on master and is slightly outside the scope of this PR, so me or someone else will probably look at it separately.    I'm not certain that what you report is a regression caused by my PR - how much time did you play with master (after kd's latest PR) without seeing a black flash?    EDIT: I see the exact same warnings on master:    PR= `·E 0:03:15.213828 {rsx::thread} RSX: Cached object for address 0xC0000000 was found, but it does not match stored parameters (width=16 vs 16; height=16 vs 16; depth=6 vs 1; mipmaps=0 vs 1)`    master= `E {rsx::thread} RSX: Cached object for address 0xC0000000 was found, but it does not match stored parameters.

Did you build it yourself on Windows? In which case, could you build it with Debug information and provide the full call stack? That would be very helpful.    @kd-11   > What happens when the application requests a format to draw into that is not supported? You will end up with a null render pass handle.    Yes, if a render pass is not possible on the Vulkan driver, then RPCS3 will need to crash gracefully on an attempt to use such a pass. This is better than crashing at initialization without knowing if the pass is going to be ever needed in the first place.    > Which are these formats missing from metal/gfxrs?    Unfortunately, Metal on MacOS (specifically, there is no such restriction on iOS/tvOS) [doesn't support](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) packed 16bit color formats, such as R5G6B5 or A1R5G5B5.    > At least throw when use of unsupported formats is attempted and mention that its because of driver incompatibility.

As you can see from the workflow, these fixes were developed independently for different problems, so mixing them in one bag of a "Various fixes PR" wouldn't be a clean approach either.    > makes merging a little easier, since it would be more apparent that there are no conflicts, or if there are conflicts    Maybe your merging process is not familiar to me. In other projects you'll instantly see if a PR becomes non-mergeable. And it's not a problem of reviewer as much as it of a PR author.

I would highly recommend switching this requirement off:  ![screenshot from 2018-09-07 14-35-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107301/45236947-5fba5980-b2ab-11e8-91f2-f9bc38d0d2ea.png)    That would streamline review/landing process quite a bit.  In gfx-rs we use [Bors](https://app.bors.tech/) to land all the things in 99% of cases (e.g. https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/2385). Thus, reviewer just says "bors r+" and they do all the testing on CI, rebasing and landing tasks automatically. Hooking it up is really easy, just requires admin permissions on the project.|2018-09-07 18:38:02|kvark

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5092|2018-09-06 19:40:36|2018-09-07 19:02:04|@kd-11   *Copying* is fine, it's the blitting that's not so easy. Blitting is different in that it [requires a graphics queue](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkCmdBlitImage.html), and can be implemented under the hood as a graphics operation.    Also, it's not BGRA8 that is problematic but the fact of placing it in HOST_VISIBLE memory (with linear tiling). Vulkan baseline requirements for HOST_VISIBLE images are super low, e.g. only 2D with a few formats, and they aren't required to support any graphics operations. Basically, they are glorified staging buffers, and that's how Metal portability backend implements them. Hence, they can only be used in transfers.|2018-09-07 18:10:09|kvark

Makes sense, otherwise it would have been strange as drivers often just implement blitting with a full-quad pass which would have made the user-side implementation of the same redundant.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5032|2018-08-24 21:13:11|2018-09-18 10:07:34|Splitting VS projects didn't do any significant service. Rather the opposite. In particular, it disallowed effective use of the precompiled header - we either had to have several precompiled headers for each project, or had to disable them. Currently only emucore.vcxproj uses a single one, as a compromise.    However, I think that removing current solution files and switching to CMake completely may be a good compromise too. In this case, enumerating all files for compilation seems much more attractive because there is only one place of change.    But creating a lot of targets creates more complexity in the same field, because now a programmer has to think a lot about said dependencies. It should be really much easier if there are only two non-3rdparty targets: emucore and rpcs3qt.|2018-09-06 20:00:37|Nekotekina
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5032|2018-08-24 21:13:11|2018-09-18 10:07:34|Several precompiled headers would be entirely reasonable especially if different components would be encapsulated well. Eg. it would be nice if graphics API headers wouldn't be included in any of the public headers of the RSX that are included to other components. That kind of encapsulation would also reduce compile times and need for precompiled headers.    I am also hoping that we can move to use one build system for all platforms. This pull request is first step towards that. Hopefully we get good usage experiences from this and can improve Windows + CMake development experience to same levels as with visual studio project files.    I actually added precompiled header as a separate target but now that I think of it it probably doesn't currently work correctly. Probably would need some cotire function calls to enable usage of that precompiled header in all targets.    IMHO programmer _should_ think about dependencies. Not having automatically everything available forces programmer to think about the dependencies and takes steps to avoid adding additional dependencies. Hidden dependencies make it easy to code messy code that does too many things and in wrong places.    Emucore might require some refactoring and better encapsulation of different components before splitting it to different components provides much benefit. So keeping it as a single library also has its benefits and is a good option.|2018-09-06 20:33:07|kukkamario
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5032|2018-08-24 21:13:11|2018-09-18 10:07:34|Precompiled headers are big, and in practice, they almost repeated themselves. So not wanting it very much.    Many things that would be good... I just say that if adding another cpp file requires more complicated work and deep understanding of CMake targets (away from C++), it only encourages to make it even more messy by growing existing headers or translation units with new functionality which may or may not fit in there. That's the reality we have to deal with.    I currently see no benefits of multiple targets. Just some kind of logic association, which is fragile. The idea of emucore separation from rpcs3qt comes from the possibility to run it separately, without GUI.    Cleaning up the includes should be good for compilation time, but requires a lot of hard work. If C++ modules are available, they should help a lot, due to the elimination of the transitive inclusion problem.    Can you just drop VS solutions in the same PR?|2018-09-06 21:04:04|Nekotekina
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5032|2018-08-24 21:13:11|2018-09-18 10:07:34|Ideally adding new file to project shouldn't require anything else than writing its name to CMakeLists.txt in the same folder (if GLOB is not used). Doing anything more than that, is only required if the new source file requires additional dependencies that were not previously used in that library. In that case adding the target name of the library to target_link_libraries should be enough (difference between PUBLIC and PRIVATE link libraries probably should be explained in some "How to use CMake" doc).    I think I'll agree with you and combine emucore back to a single library. Splitting it to separate libraries can be done in another pull request later when some refactoring work has been done and it provides more benefits.    Based on discussion in Discord when I started working on this pull request, I don't think dropping VS solutions can be done yet. Many had strong opinions that they don't want their workflow to be affected especially before trying out Windows + CMake development setup. People need a transfer period for setting up their environments for CMake. So we have to keep double build system setup at least for a while for developers to test this.    Best option is probably to make another pull request which removes VS project and does some reorganization of source files. I didn't move any source files in this pull request just because I didn't want to do anything that affects vs project build. In the new pull request it would be possible to eg. move Utilities to rpcs3 folder and asmjit, Vulkan and llvm to 3rdparty folder.    |2018-09-06 21:30:01|kukkamario

Also AFAIK emucore is usable as a library (and was refactored at some point to enable that?) so it makes sense to keep emucore and rpcs3 separate targets.    Currently Utilities is still split to multiple targets even though it doesn't anymore provide benefit because building emucore requires them all. Utilities seems to contain quite unstructured mess of code (eg. JIT.cpp should probably be moved to somewhere in emucore...).  I don't really like adding source files to CMakeLists.txt that are not in subdirectories of the CMakeLists directory. It makes targets look messy in IDEs and build directories.|2018-09-12 17:09:30|kukkamario

I decided to split Utilities into 3 targets:  rpcs3_core_utilities:    - File, Log, Thread, StrFmt, VirtualMemory    - These are all included in the precompiled header which means that they are linked to pretty much every target    rpcs3_utilities_jit:    - JIT.cpp    - Only file that uses asmjit and llvm so I didn't want to include this to the main rpcs3_utilities target    rpcs3_utilities    - Everything else    - Also links to core_utilities with PUBLIC visibility so they are also included    Maybe even more detailed splitting could be beneficial but not without properly separating different utility libraries into separate folders.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/5032|2018-08-24 21:13:11|2018-09-18 10:07:34|Enumerating source files manually is the recommended way to use CMake. CMake documentation discourages using GLOB and GLOB_RECURSE because adding source files requires always manually running CMake because CMake can't detect that reconfiguring is required because CMake scripts aren't changed. It's not like visual studio project files wouldn't require manually adding source files. But I kinda expected that this point might be raised because most of the development is done using visual studio project files which is why I didn't bother to change all libraries to list their source files explicitly.    Small targets discourage creating dependencies between unrelated components, make it possible to easily compile different components with different options and provide good structure. My personal preference would be to split it even smaller targets and add clear public interface and private interface distinction by separating them to different folders and limiting include paths so including header file of a library that is not linked to the target doesn't work. But that can't probably be reasonably done as long as msvc project files are used and it would require large scale refactoring to code also because many files do so many things and include half the project.    Small targets vs big targets is a preference thing. Emucore could be a single library, but splitting it by subfolders felt logical. Visual studio Project files split different RSX backends to separate targets.  |2018-09-06 19:40:50|kukkamario

Although, CPU could be working with the HOST_VISIBLE memory directly (instead of doing "CPU->buffer1" copy), in which case there is a single copy.

This is incredible! Thank you for addressing our blockers so promptly! :heart:   When implementing this, please make sure to follow the standard Vulkan logic instead of adding `#ifdef __APPLE__`: check the memory types in buffer requirements, and work around if the implementation can't support it.

With the old approach, you were using `HOST_COHERENT & HOST_VISIBLE` memory, and since Vulkan spec requires the implementation to return a memory type with more properties first, you were likely getting `DEVICE_LOCAL` there as well. So the old approach is already allocating VRAM for those buffers, very likely.    In the new approach, you'd have the same `DEVICE_LOCAL` buffers, just not visible to the host, plus some scratch space (even if the size of the buffer) that is `HOST_VISIBLE` but not `DEVICE_LOCAL`, so it's allocated from RAM and not VRAM.    > cpu is often used to offload vertex calculations on ps3    So some applications tend to update the vertex data every frame from CPU, and some (minority?) do not?|2018-08-23 16:04:11|kvark

I might wait a little (estimate, given the fast progress :-) ) to (in increasing easiness level for me to test):  1) this PR being in master (with fixed LLVM?)  2) continous prebuilt binaries for Macos.. https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/5015  3) once this PR in master and assuming Mac CI builds take longer to arrive I can download frequent builds from (http://www.emucr.com) and as you know Wine has Vulkan support on MacOS using MoltenVK.. sadly not enabled by default on https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/download.html.. anyway I have it compiled and in fact I checked rpcs3 Windows binary about a month ago and tried running gs_gcm_basic_triangle.elf (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/205) I got:  [MoltenVK ERROR] VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT: Vulkan extension VK_EXT_debug_report is not supported.  so question is if can you make use of this extension conditionally on platforms that don't support it? like MoltenVK.. I already requested support for it on MoltenVK site but seems support for it can take a while..  one question for @kvark is if "portability" supports VK_EXT_debug_report or this PR disables somehow use of it..  forgot to say that running Windows binary also has the advantage of avoiding X11 issues I found in my last testing around 5 months ago(https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/4293) peharps that issue is already fixed I'm not up to speed on RPCS3 Macos changes..  4) have been seeing also latests commits in master like:  "vk: Implement double-buffered heaps for platforms without universal support for host visibility (APPLE)"  "vk: Support sw component swizzle decode because metal sucks "   and more..  and seems like most Vulkan "massaging changes" for Metal are not platform dependant.. but swizzle changes are with #ifdef __APPLE__ so seems running RPCS3 Windows binary under Wine on Macos will hit the swizzle issues.. so question is can the "not needing swizzle support" code be enabled on all cases (even for Windows builds) or has a performance hit?

The game no longer gets past intro and still does not work with any current build since this pr. The game goes ingame fine with build 0.0.5-7182 but has regressed to intro ever since 0.0.5-7186.      I tried fresh install of both the emulator and game and different settings, TSX on/off etc.. but same result.     the error code always is:     F {PPU[0x1000008] Thread (Utility PPU Thread) [0x00013500]} MEM: Access violation reading location 0xe2d0a0a0    |2018-09-09 13:26:22|incognitoh

After a lot more time reviewing the texture cache code and pestering @kd-11 with many questions (thank you for your help!) I found a third bug:    - `invalidate_range_impl_base` does not mark some textures that will only be  unprotected as dirty when doing a deferred flush, since that is done by  `flush_all`. However, if there are no sections to flush, the deferred flush will  use the same code path as non-deferred flushes for unprotecting textures  and forget to mark them as dirty.    With this fix I believe I have finally tracked down the bug causing the P5 texture swaps (see #4298), but further testing is needed.|2018-08-13 19:55:42|ruipin

[Update 3] Backbreaker OpenGL performance is significantly increased on this PR. It's finally full speed for the first time!! Strict rendering fixes all the remaining gfx issues also (looks perfect). so the ONLY issue preventing the game from being 100% "Playable" is the stupid PPU error that gets hit randomly:  F {PPU[0x1000033] Thread (Morpheme-PS3-Update 1) [0x0057f8a0]} class std::runtime_error thrown: Verification failed (e=0x57):   (in file Emu\Cell\lv2\sys_cond.cpp:279)    And just one more note: after playing for a bit, the color in the field turns yellow in some rows.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4876|2018-07-11 21:14:03|2018-07-14 12:19:58|I'm curious, and so people are aware, should we expect similar issues to those that Dolphin saw when they tried asynchronous shaders? Or do these kinds of issues not occur in RPCS3?    I'll quote their [Ubershaders blog post](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/30/ubershaders/):    > In the end, it just came down to the fact that the people who could have implemented [asynchronous shaders] along with other core developers were against it as a solution. They saw it as nothing more than a hack that would cause a lot of false positives on the issue tracker and cause bigger issues down the road. Those worries were proven somewhat valid when you realize that some games need objects to be rendered on the frame they expect it to be. In this case, the Mii heads are only rendered once to the Embedded Framebuffer. If the EFB copy is missing because of Async Shader Compilation, the Mii heads will not show up for the remainder of the game or until they're regenerated.|2018-07-11 22:47:19|ruipin

You said Raging Blast 2 has problems with fragment shader compilation, right? Do you know approx when it will be fixed?    Here is the log. Also, if trophy popup is enabled, the game freezes every time a trophy appears. (In master there are a few times when it doesn't but usually trophy makes it freezes there too.)

If you restart the game the shader will have been saved to cache and faces will be ok. Or disable async to force synchronous compilation making sure the writes are always present.

Thats just how they are designed and explains why some tests will have white output without the option. Technically speaking a permanent form of WCB is always enabled on blit resources which is why some games can get away with that setting set to off.  I'm more interested in scenarios where cpu blit + WCB (mandatory, they have to go together), gives different results vs cpu blit disabled.

You can mark it as WIP while you add more parts to it. Merging will happen one PR at a time, likely with some time in between (you have to start a new build after every merge as the PRs become outdated after each merging). As for review, things like build integration aren't too critical as they do not actually change emulator functionality.

But for example on Persona 5 the FPS fluctuates enormously now with big falls, the audio stutter enormously, the video intro stutter also whereas before it was fluid and overall the perfs are very bad in terms of feeling, much worse than the master.    This is also the case on other games, but it is a bit on a case-by-case basis, I imagine that games using SPU on a massive scale are more affected.    Ironically with the SPU LLVM and these new timings we get better performances than on master, unfortunately very few game works with the SPU LLVM.    Clearly it will be very complicated to adapt this code as much for quadcore and less than for Ryzen 7/i7... |2018-05-27 16:01:34|Illynir

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4661|2018-05-26 11:51:00|2018-05-29 10:54:31|The problem here is fairly simple, lowering the yield threshold will allow usleep to jump to 501us for every sleep duration above it on windows, so we can lower it to say, 10 and suddenly some CPUs are happy again. This is however tricky and will hide timing problems, bringing issues like emulator freezing or unpredictable performance in some situations. I'm also not comfortable with yet another config option, we already have a mess of options right now with many reports of bad performance being the result of poor understanding of the configuration options.

I always test all possibilities with the "Spu thread" (Auto/1/2), with or without "Lower Spu thread", with or without "Spu loop detection", ASMJIT or SPU LLVM, etc.. I spend a lot of time on this every time to get an objective opinion.    Even if some options can help a little (notably disable everything related to SPU in fact) it is clear that overall performance is lower than on Master and that audio stutter much more.    The only combination that works better for me compared to the Master are the games that work with the SPU LLVM, which is very rare as you know.    Then I don't know what else to say and I have no interest in inventing problems that don't exist.|2018-05-27 16:36:09|Illynir

Regression in performance almost everywhere and SPU options (Spu loop detection, Spu thread, Lower spu thread) behave strangely and often lead to an even stronger regression instead of improving performance.    You should consider either an automatic detection of the number of threads or an option to disable it so that it is viable on weaker PCs like i5.|2018-05-26 15:47:52|Illynir

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4661|2018-05-26 11:51:00|2018-05-29 10:54:31|as of bb8a098  for P5 changing SPU threads number to Auto brought no observable FPS changes (still very low, somewhere between 5 and 15), however changing it to 1 brought FPS up to 24 in menu and lessened audio stutter (on master FPS on 1 is lower than on 2). On other spu thread counts FPS remains roughly the same as on Auto. Actually, it would be great to have a debug option to log FPS and then get some overall statistics like min/max/average. It will allow measuring overall performance gain/loss on different settings/prs/commits/system configurations. It would be even better to bind FPS logging to a button so we could start/stop it while emulation is running. <br>  EDIT_2: As kd-11 suggested i started to iterate over different combinations of CPU options.   So far:  Persona 5:  __Enabling Thread scheduler greatly decreases performance on any thread  count;__     Spu thread number 2 still gives bests performance with Thread scheduler disabled;    Enabling SPU loop detection decreases audio stutter and increases FPS ingame, but videos start to stutter a lot more  (it seems the higher thread count the biggers is the performance increase, for example on 6 threads with enabled loop detection and disabled scheduler works almost as good as on 2 threads excluding periodical fps spikes but on 2 threads loop detection hardly gives any increase);    Enabling lower SPU thread priority increases FPS. Performance increase differs for different thread counts, for example on 6 there is almost no increase, on 5 it is up to 10 FPS, and on 4 it is also not noticeable. (we really need some fps statistics. I can capture my screen using software or using my phone (to avoid additional CPU usage) and then create a fps timetable(or rather fps change index/value table) to tell you any gains/loss for sure but that is to much hassle considering I will either have to do it a few times or for a relatively long period of time on both configs(disabled/enabled) for statistics to be usable);    System:  OS: Windows 10 1803 x64  CPU: i5-6500  GPU: Nvidia GTX970  RAM: 16 GB ddr4|2018-05-29 08:37:17|ZeeWanderer

Names also have no real meaning on intel CPUs (some i7s are dual cores, and there are xeons in there as well) and trying to detect physical CPUs is more trouble than its worth due to intel changing cpuid bits all the time.

In that case we need a gcm_sys callback that then optionally invokes the rsx::thread back-end callback. The rsx::thread callback is for the rsx side of things only and does not actually interact with gcm_sys. Maybe can be provided as a util function that checks if memory is rsx mapped, then once confirmed to exist, invokes the existing on_memory_unmapped callback and updates the offset tables.|2018-05-27 13:48:45|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4639|2018-05-22 15:16:06|2018-05-23 10:54:29|First of all, I do not think psycho-A's issue was really because of vkstatic linking, unless driver loading protocol has changed again. The one benefit of linking against the dll instead of the library is that we do not need to update the precompiled library. However, this will (and I guarantee this will happen) make rpcs3 fail on systems with broken vulkan setup since vulkan-1.dll will likely not be configured correctly. Ironically the solution to this is shipping vulkan-1.dll which contains the same code as vkstatic and has the exact same pitfalls. We switched to vkstatic from vulkan-1 which is the default for this reason.  That said, I'll leave the decision up to those who deal with our #help channel as they will be responsible for diagnosing vulkan library problems with this changeset.|2018-05-22 17:56:14|kd-11

Since the emulator actually can´t connect and finish the steps to online check the downloaded content, probably is safer to assume that the system is offline than makes it wait an event, through a callback, that will not trigger.   |2018-05-22 21:04:34|ikki84

I tested:     Demon's Souls BLUS30443  I'm getting a frequent issue... I'm using the recommended settings available in the Demon's Souls page, I can play the game normally at locked 30fps until the Nexus part, when I access the stone to travel to the Boletarian, the game gets into a endless loading screen, the frame rate varies at the top of the emulator's window showing it doesn't frozen at all but it doesn't pass through the loading screen. Not matter how many time I wait, it gets stuck on that loading screen forever. Doesn't matter which settings I try the issue still happens.    Mirror's Edge NUP30838  This build at least for me, keep the same error as the previous ones, the game runs fine but gives little but constants freezes every momment and sound cuts during these freezes either, anyway the game is playable just to report, the fps is good locks at 30fps for me when the game doesn't give these little freezes.     Unnamed NPUB31848  The games runs fine using the recommended settings, but the fps varies too much depending on the point where you're looking at, the fps drops drastically, from 30fps to 13 fps. But the game is playable, not freezes or delays during the CGs or the opening just the annoying variation of framerate on ryzen processors.

While this is an independent study the details match up with other low level functions that need to be process specific which would mean false removing the request is intended.    Your confusion likely stems from the use of the word "set" and a "true"/"false" value. By providing "false" you are telling it that you do not need the time interval set anymore. Your original, almost certainly incorrect, assumption is that you're not telling it to set a value.    do a test, hereafter "power report" means run   `powercfg -energy duration 5`  and then open the file which should be put in C:/Windows/System32/energy-report.html, scroll down to the first few yellow blocks under "warnings" the first will be the default platform timer details, the second+ blocks should be any outstanding timer requests you have.    open 2+ timertools (as many as you like), set different values for each.  check the power report -> every single timertool will be listed. Click "unset timer" on one, check the power report you'll see that one is delisted. Change the value on another to 12ms, check the power report, you will notice that the value of that one changed to 12ms but is not removed.  |2018-05-16 19:33:43|Relsig

In main(), rpcs3 sets it to 1 msec.  2.  Then once the QT5 logging library is loaded, QT5 library sets it to 1 msec.    If we simply set NtSetTimerResolution to 0.5 msec in main(), the QT5 library will override it.    So, NtSetTimerResolution was moved to the start of emulation.  Now the problem is how to restore the timer resolution after emulation has stopped.  We'd like to restore it as it saves power and we're being good Windows citizens.    There are two choices right now:    1. NtSetTimerResolution(m_orig_timer_resolution, true, &curr_res)       advantages - qt5 request of 1 msec is still honored.     disadvantages - the original timer resolution could be < 1 msec if another process had set it to 0.5 msec.    2. NtSetTimerResolution(0, false, &curr_res)       advantages - will correctly release the timer resolution request for the process. The timer resolution can then go back to 15 msec.    disadvantages - does not honor the QT5 1msec request.    If the QT5 request is just for logging and we really only care about logging speed during actual emulation, I'd say we go with #2.    I'll prepare the change.      |2018-05-16 22:41:47|pauls-gh

If the UI doesn't care about the system timer, as it honestly shouldn't, removing timeBegin/end completely is the way to go. You don't want to increase power consumption if you don't have to.    You need to make sure you're removing your request for a lower timer using  NtSetTimerResolution(5000, FALSE, &currentres)  otherwise you may permanently set the timer to 1ms, which can effectively nullify any power saving settings the computer has. My PC defaults to 15.625ms.    You can test this by opening 2 timer tools and setting/unsetting the values arbitrarily or just looking at the timertool's source which is available at http://github.com/tebjan/TimerTool    You might also consider implementing NtQueryTimerResolution and checking that 0.5ms is available before setting it because while it -should- be it may not be.

You first have to isolate the opengl bug for mesa, afaik ogl was working fine without hard-locking the GPU. There exists a workaround for broken vertexID but that only affects proprietary drivers and that is the existing openGL workaround. There is no known primitive restart bug on mesa as of now unless you have found one? Disable primitive restart and see if it fixes the problem (the robustness extension will guarantee that the application shall not crash because of out-of-bounds error). You can find the enable in GLGSRender::end  2. Thanks for testing RADV, will add proper patch for it since adding it to "radeon" group is incorrect. Proprietary driver has a dangerous fence reset bug that needs separate workarounds.|2018-05-09 07:53:47|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4497|2018-04-29 18:09:55|2018-06-09 08:06:56|@AniLeo By default, Linux (which includes Travis) does not use the Vulkan submodule to build RPCS3. We only rely on the distribution package. Therefore, it is not mandatory to update Travis when we update the Vulkan submodule. As a proof, I removed the Vulkan submodule checkout and Travis will be able to build without issues. The AppImage generated will also have the Vulkan renderer available.    Still, we can, if we want, update the libvulkan*.deb files for Travis but we have to keep in mind that we are limited by Ubuntu 14.04. We use the packages with "ubuntu1~16.04" in the names for compatibility reasons I think. I haven't found any new packages available with the same pattern in the name and a newer package might not work.|2018-05-01 13:02:47|scribam
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4497|2018-04-29 18:09:55|2018-06-09 08:06:56|Yes, Travis builds because it pulls from universe, but there are new universe packages available. If you don't update Travis you'll have the Windows builds building against a much newer version in comparison to Linux. |2018-05-01 14:02:28|AniLeo

Which packages would you recommend to use?  I don't think there is a way to have the packages and the submodules synchronized. The most recent package is from "14-Mar-2018" whereas the submodule is more recent.    @kd-11 What are your thoughts on the topic?|2018-05-01 14:10:17|scribam

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4475|2018-04-22 01:32:29|2018-04-29 17:38:01|I pushed some new changes that moves the initialization to when you're booting a game as there was no reason to do it on app startup if you don't update the presence. This also makes it easier to minimize presence updates. Rich presence will not be initialized now if the option is off at startup. There is however some problems with how presence works, such as the fact that if you terminate rich presence, it doesn't update the presence, so the game will still show. And the fact that if you call terminate too quickly after you update the presence (to clear it), the presence will not be updated.    So if you don't want to make a new thread that wait for a second and then terminates, this option needs an app restart or it will still use rich presence, just with a clear presence. Ideas are welcome.|2018-04-22 14:15:22|isJuhn

E {PPU[0x100000c] Thread (fios mediathread 11) [0x02b44090]} 'sys_fs_open' failed with 0x80010006 : CELL_ENOENT, “/dev_bdvd/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/Data/SOUND/SndPak.pak” [1]    I figured I'd clarify exactly what the game is doing since I reread my post and it was a bit unclear.    The ISO has three folders within the game folder.    PS3_GAME  PS3_GM01  PS3_GM02    All *three* of these are stand-alone games that I can be used as individual ISOs.  So if I were to split off GM01 into it's own folder as a "PS3_GAME" folder, RPCS3 will see it as a game and it'll load/function correctly.  While this works if you want to play the games, I'd rather the game work out of the box for other users if possible.  Because GM01 is more or less it's own game, the fact that RPCS3 is having the game search for files in the GAME folder is incorrect.|2018-04-16 08:42:16|JMC47

I guess I'll note that in order to add the second/third games in the collection, you have to navigate into the PS3_GM01 and PS3_GM02 folders - just adding the top folder will only add the PS3_GAME game.

BTW, following the AppImages extraction, it totally seems that there are way too many static libs packed in, IMHO, other than the latest Qt none of that makes too much sense (why there are two different versions of libpng packed in?!). Maybe AppIamge binary should only contain the very essential libs, and the rest would be provided by the distro itself?

While it may end up just being another timing issue, it seems to be 100% consistent, and using the interpreters does cause the game to start working again in this PR (but not in builds prior to 0.0.5-6655, at least for me) making me think there may be a regression in this change.  Considering the volatility of the hang (and how it seems to have simply vanished with an "unrelated" change) I can't exactly say why this reawakens it.

This allows me to test them on the latest builds.    The game performance increases are great in this pull request... until the actual puck hits the ice.  Without this Pull Request, when the first game you play starts it sometimes lags the physics a bit, but it goes away after ~15 seconds.    Here audio is running fine, but the physics in-game are running much slower than before, but,  if you pause, the puck gets held/penalty/etc. the game is running WAY better than master.  Not exactly sure how to help in this situation.  Like I said, everything except the actual gameplay while the puck is in play is so much faster that it's not funny.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4422|2018-04-09 14:50:15|2018-04-21 22:50:27|Yes, the games are working again. That being said and to be quite honest I think there is a very notable regression on processors with few threads like my i5 4670K. I have lower performance on quite a bit of game or else the sound is messing up a lot more with performance equivalent to before.    Obviously it depends on the games and it's especially on those who rely a lot on SPU. So I don't really know what to think, I guess on an i7 or a Ryzen the performance has improved but is closing the door more and more to the i5.|2018-04-13 00:11:47|Illynir

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4422|2018-04-09 14:50:15|2018-04-21 22:50:27|This is exactly what I say, on i7, Ryzen and globally those with many threads the performances are identical or better. On i5 with only 4 threads I see several regressions on quite a few games in terms of overall performance on games using massively SPU. So it's kind of logical that you don't have the problems I'm talking about since you have an i7 of the same family as mine, the only difference being the number of threads, 8 for you 4 for me.    The number of threads is more important than the instruction set, below a critical threshold it poses a problem with RPCS3 which uses it massively. On this PR the difference is even more marked, that's what I'm saying.|2018-04-13 01:37:14|Illynir

For example on Asura's wrath that I finished on RPCS3, I had almost all the time 30 FPS. With this last builds the FPS vary a lot for me, I go from 30 to 7 then 15 then it comes back to 30 falls back to 5 etc....    The shaders had nothing to do with it, having finished the game I have all the shaders in the game. It also does that to me on Drakengard 3, Dante's inferno and many more on my i5 4670K.

We want to isolate the change, not mesh it together with the rest.    I'd recommend the following. This is complicated by the fact you opened this PR using your master (avoid that in the future and just make feature branches), but okay.    `git fetch RPCS3` -- This fetches the changes from the main repository.  `git checkout RPCS3/master` -- This switches your current checked out state to the state of the main repository.  `git cherry-pick a2e641fb383e5ccef471c9c6dc0264b66b954fc9` -- This takes a single commit (the one with the fix here, a2e641fb383e5ccef471c9c6dc0264b66b954fc9) and applies it on top of the currently checked out state.  `git branch srm-fix` -- This takes the current state (main repo + fix commit) and gives it a name, so we can easily refer to it later.  `git checkout master` -- Switch back to this branch you opened the PR on.  `git reset --hard srm-fix` -- Overwrite the `master` state with the state we stored in `srm-fix`.  `git push --force` -- And push the fixed state up to Github.|2018-03-27 18:11:49|AdmiralCurtiss

So instead, this worked for me.    **git rebase -i upstream/master**   => interactive rebase with upstream.  I chose the single commit (SRM fix) that still needs to be upstreamed.    **git push -f**  => force push local to origin    Now my fork shows that I'm correctly one commit ahead of RPCS3/master        |2018-03-28 16:03:33|pauls-gh

Anything that results in users using correct settings will result in less users asking for help or complaining that RPCS3 is slow. And trust me, it does happen quite often.

As long as the physical device has the string "RX 480" the workarounds should be in effect unless you have "force primitive restart" set in your config file.

Limited RGB does have a big effect but it simulates the washed out visuals you get on standard TV display and isnt visually pleasing imo It does add some implicit brightness to the games though - can be edited in config.yml  As for downpour getting darker menus, that will have to be investigated separately as the detection code was scrapped and now the game's texture settings are just blindly implemented in the fragment shaders with no special code or hacks. Probably caused by one setting implicitly overriding another.|2018-03-25 10:30:49|kd-11

More questions:    - Should the User Manager have "Save and Close" and "Close Without Saving" buttons? Or is it ok with "Close," and saving the setting immediately?  - I had a problem with the Q_OBJECT macro - it wouldn't build if I left it in the user_manager_dialog class. Taking it out seems to have no effect, other than letting me build. (?)|2018-03-20 02:54:49|mpm11011
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4300|2018-03-17 18:54:33|2018-07-25 23:16:52|Q_Object should definitely be used in this case since you're using slots and connects. That macro tells QT's MOC (meta object compiler, what let's Qt do connects in first place with slots and stuff) to function. That'll create the autogenerated file that you can find.    From a cursory glance on my phone (lul), I can't tell why you're getting an error from that macro, but you should definitely be using it.    On top of my head, usually it's because you aren't including something that inherits QObject, but that's impossible given your includes. Otherwise, sometimes, the generated files DONT generate. So you got to cheese Qt a bit. It's simple. Remove qobject. Save. Readd it. Save again. It should pause a bit on saving. That's because it's forcefully rewriting the project's solution file to inform of the auto moc command.    If you still have issues, hit me up on discord.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/4292|2018-03-16 17:23:21|2018-03-21 11:11:06|I added a test to make sure the compiler supports "-march=native" before to add this compile option. As such, cmake now outputs:  ```  -- Performing Test COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MARCH_NATIVE  -- Performing Test COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MARCH_NATIVE - Success  ```  if USE_NATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS is set + "Success" if "-march=native" is supported by the compiler.  Because I cannot see this output in Travis logs, I assume it builds the AppImages without "-march=native".    I don't know exactly what the issue is with OpenSUSE OBS but I saw  ```  sed -i \  -e 's Qt5 5.[0-9]\+ Qt5 g' \  -e 's -march=native -msse -msse2 -mcx16 -mrtm g' \  %{name}/CMakeLists.txt  ```  which is probably a workaround they found when dealing with a not working USE_NATIVE_INSTRUCTIONS.

Its purpose is to send messages to the event queue registered with the `cellCameraSetNotifyEventQueue*` functions. Such messages are camera connected, camera disconnected and frame update events.    It is therefore useless if the camera handler is set to Null, so the current code is fine. All functions check for its existence before trying to use it, so it is safe as well.    *Edit*: Er, that's not true actually, there's a couple in there that don't check.

OpenGL is also 30fps locked, but has more audio stutter. I suspect it has to do with uneven frametimes due to the balancing algorithm being not well tuned yet. Audio stutter with vulkan should be at a minimum.    P.S - The performance drop is warranted. The game is actually copying data from a render target to an allocated buffer, something akin to glGetTexSubImage.

Was wondering if it's just on my system (arch linux, r9 fury), 2 minor pbs:  1) the statues stage is much slower (drops from 60 to 40fps)  2) the ruins stage is glitchy for me on OpenGl: it's mostly black at the beginning then it appears when I move up. Then the floor seems transparent. I noticed it's the only stage in which we leave tracks on the ground. Vulkan (radv) is ok (but very slow:25fps when OGL is 60).    ![fps 59 94 opengl 0 0 4-6360 virtua fighter 5 final showdown npub30625 _014](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/35537564-f114e774-054a-11e8-98c2-c123aaecbb3d.jpg)  ![fps 59 99 opengl 0 0 4-6360 virtua fighter 5 final showdown npub30625 _015](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/35537567-f4fc738e-054a-11e8-93ad-9819490b5362.jpg)  ![fps 23 93 vulkan 0 0 4-6360 virtua fighter 5 final showdown npub30625 _016](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/35537572-f7c7e18e-054a-11e8-8117-0d01432de087.jpg)  |2018-01-29 20:51:27|toccata10

Just as an aside, I am not sure if this solution is more of a work around. I am assuming in an ideal world that an AppImage is supposed to be self contained and as such should have no dependencies on the host system?    The fact that removing the libfreetype file means that it falls back to using the host provided version suggests that there are other libraries in the AppImage that are falling back to the host versions as well (resulting in the mismatch).    I am not sure how to prove it, I think it might require some input from the AppImage developers themselves but I think there is a dependency on a QT library that is not being bundled with the image.|2018-01-27 10:20:39|7oxicshadow

Maybe also hide the accept button if no saves are loaded to make it obvious to the end user that pressing X should have no result. How does the ps3 behave?|2018-01-26 15:35:11|kd-11

Only thing is i'd be hesitant about the spu stall in this form, theres no rhyme or reason to the way tag masks are assigned or used in games, and its partial luck that 'that game' benefits from the pause of that mask. This will only cause faqs and tutorials about performance using this feature for possible extra performance.     One other suggestion, if your up for more debugger improvements, in this pr or another, is the highlighting/coloring of the debug tab instructions, i think megamouse setup some system (or maybe it was all qt) to highlight cgdisasm which would be cool to get in the ppu/spu debugger|2018-01-13 05:30:48|jarveson

Edit: Something happened in the last commits (probably while introducing the automatic line breaking) that messes up some save captions with unnecessary line breaks that the UI also does not reserve space for.  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1445782/34909373-ebd33070-f89f-11e7-818a-e1fa0b1199a6.png)  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1445782/34909382-04fa318e-f8a0-11e7-96f1-0c2992b1066e.png)    It was fine before:  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1445782/34909399-53bb7922-f8a0-11e7-9813-343cced9d27b.png)  |2018-01-13 19:15:31|jjsat

I see some games really do store alot of information in the details section which is more than I expected.    Well, you got two options; add a "Is this the save you want to load?" dialog with the extra information listed or reserve some space from right side of the save menu for it. Both approaches have their drawbacks; the extra space looks weird if the game has nothing to display & can get quite cramped for long texts and the dialog option would require an addional button press.    It'd also be possible to show the extra data for selected item only, hiding and showing it as user moves from one item to another. But that'll be much harder to implement especially if you want to add smooth animations to it. You should probably save that for a future PR.|2018-01-06 16:18:02|MSuih

Problem report for interested people: Game expect to compile shaders at the start of level. If you have powerful PC it will probably happen very fast but if you don't game will think GPU stopped working (GPU hang) and will try to load "GPU hang" file and will "trap" not founding it (probably only debug/development version have it). You can bruteforce it to the game by resetting it compile some shaders before crash (81 shaders are needed and it take me 27 restarts each one minute long).   Now it is fixed. What I don't know if it because we are printing compiling shaders at compilation time (what game takes as GPU working) or this branch compile shaders many times faster.|2018-01-07 00:21:39|woj1993

At this point what needs to be done is refactoring ppu_load_overlay_exec and ppu_load_exec so their functions do not overlap* (overlay module is more or less a smaller version of ppu exec with less features from my point of view).  Since the graphics are broken i'm keeping this PR as is, unless i find a reason why overlay modules would cause corrupted graphics.    As to why mgs4 graphics are broken all i can say is: i do not know.  There are three possibilites:  a) i missed something  b) i did something wrong  c) it's completely unrelated  |2018-10-23 16:34:27|Inviuz

I was a bit surprised as I didn't expect to have it there, I thought it would be in the CPU section  - I had a minor issue when I tried to set manually the value of "Max LLVM Compile Threads" in the config.yml file. If I set the value to the maximum number of threads (8 for my computer), save the config file then go to the Debug tab, the value is not "All (8)" but "7". Probably because "All (8)" is 0 in the config file. It is a bit disturbing but I guess people should not mess with the config file like that :slightly_smiling_face:  However, do you think this behaviour could be improved?|2018-01-13 16:52:49|scribam

However, it will be added to the Emulator tab to be accessible to everyone  - The initial behaviour with "0" meaning "All" in the config file will be kept to handle changes such as disabling HT or changing the number of cores enabled which can have an impact on the maximum number of threads|2018-01-15 19:39:04|scribam

About the ergonomy: I would prefer these 2 things:  1) display the evdev number next (before or after) to the controller name on the gamepad settings panel  2) be able to load/save a file instead of a profile number as I can give more explicit names. This probably means duplicate the file selection on the "configure evdev" panel and add a "load" button on it.|2017-12-26 07:21:54|toccata10

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3978|2017-12-23 21:26:49|2018-01-09 23:17:03|Woudn't it be better to store the profiles as a vector rather than a fixed-lenght array? That way you could arrange them more freely and delete unneeded profiles from the middle of the list. You'd have to add profile naming though, else it would get confusing really fast. Some kind of dynamic loading would be worth looking into as well to avoid clogging up the system if users create large amounts of profiles.    Saving the profiles as individual files and then f.ex. loading a whole /profiles folder into the UI would be an neat feature as well, but I'd imagine it woudn't be easy to implement since you'd have to work through the OS and it's file system.|2017-12-27 09:17:45|MSuih

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3978|2017-12-23 21:26:49|2018-01-09 23:17:03|It works nicely with evdev.  1) Now, I wonder why "evdev_positive_axis" is a separate file: shouldn't the parameters be included at the end of the yml profile file ? I wondered why after changing ABS_X and ABS_Y to true, it works fine with my dragonrise and xbox360 sticks (I predicted it shouldn't work with xbox360, but it works).  2) the evdev event number works fine. That's good: it's easier to distinguish same brand controllers.  3) I suggest adding a "Delete profile" button: it'll be easier for everyone, instead of having to digg in the subfolders.  4) I should get my hands on a DS4 controller soon, so I'll can test that.

The game seems to check for the existence of any save data with cellSaveDataUserListAutoLoad(), but does not want any actual data returned so it sets setBuf->dirListMax to 0. Handling of this case in the emulator is corrected in the last commit.    The game is still not able to proceed when trying to save. This is a different issue. E: Autosaves in game work fine.

The reason why I did the more complicated lv2_obj::sleep waiting is because thread_ctrl::wait_for does not work in this situation. I have not looked into the scheduling behaviour of the emu in detail but in both games thread_ctrl::wait_for adds a delay but after that goes on as if no wait had happened. So it does obviously not reschedule as needed here.    Here is the behaviour for Wolfenstein:  - with thread_ctrl::wait_for: save is selected - savedata_op() is called - wait is called -> screen freezes for a second - savedata_op() returns - games shows "Reading save data" message on screen and hangs forever  - with lv2_obj::sleep: save is selected - savedata_op() is called - wait is called - games shows "Reading save data" and does not freeze - savedata_op() returns - game starts loading the map    Here it is for Thor:  - with thread_ctrl:wait_for: savedata_op() is called - wait is called -> game continues but does not return to main menu  - with lv2_obj::sleep: savedata_op() is called - wait is called -> game continues - savedata_op() returns - game goes to main menu    Also whie loading the save data during startup Thor displays a black screen on a PS3. With the lv2_obj::sleep patch it does this too. With thread_ctrl::wait_for it does not switch to black at all.

I replaced the call to funcFile with your code and it does not call the callback function at all (disable optimization, put a breakpoint on the function call, no hit). The thread itself waits in the "while (wait)" loop forever.    e: What is more important is that thread_ctrl::wait_for is very random in its effect and I guess very much depends on what other PPU thread (other than the one delayed I mean) is running. You can also see that in the save dialog or message dialogs. Some games completely freeze while the dialog is displayed instead of updating the background and the sound and others are able to update the background and play sound.|2018-01-06 09:03:39|jjsat

If no savegame is found on startup the game expects the call to cellSaveListAutoLoad to fail. It has to fail because the game returns 2 as the result of the funcFixed callback. I have not checked the other save functions that use the funcFixed callback, but there is actually a comment in the code that indicates that CELL_SAVEDATA_CBRESULT_OK_LAST_NOCONFIRM is not a valid return value for all callbacks.

I downloaded a save of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, decrypted it and replaced a save in the Wipeout HD demo with it. It did not enumerate any files which was clearly wrong.    Btw. Wipeout HD demo is pretty nice for checking this as it dumps information about the saves and callbacks to TTY without having to write your own game.    There is one noticable difference between this code and the real hardware, but it probably does not affect anything: sysSizeKB seems to be always 0x23 even if the save file does not exist yet and therefore there are no files in the directory.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3817|2017-11-30 20:13:58|2017-12-21 14:42:54|Hi Megamouse,  A bit of testing with the evdev part:  *with this PR: ok for an xbox360 controller. Vibrations are cool too.    With my custom stick:  *on master: works fine except that the analog axis are reversed: it's ok on the config window, but when in a game: if I press up, it goes down. If I press right, it goes left.  Correct in gui window, wrong in games:  ![selection_043](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/33661463-41ed75d2-da88-11e7-82a7-0c8c202851ca.jpg)    Workaround: I press left to register right input in the config window.  Dpad is perfect.  Incorrect in gui window, correct in games:  ![selection_044](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/33661474-4bd898ba-da88-11e7-8478-539899418351.jpg)    So, while not perfect, it's very easy to configure.    *on PR: I can't register LX-, neither LY-: it always registers LZ+  So it seems like LX- and LY- are not captured.  Knowing that with an evtest, this is my output (so if I don't press anything, the gui always captures a LZ+):  ```  Event: time 1512561543.089711, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------  Event: time 1512561543.097704, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 2 (ABS_Z), value 133  Event: time 1512561543.097704, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------  Event: time 1512561543.105706, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 2 (ABS_Z), value 132  Event: time 1512561543.105706, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------  Event: time 1512561543.113707, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 2 (ABS_Z), value 131  Event: time 1512561543.113707, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------  Event: time 1512561543.121721, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 2 (ABS_Z), value 133  Event: time 1512561543.121721, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------  Event: time 1512561543.129712, type 3 (EV_ABS), code 2 (ABS_Z), value 132  ```  Sometimes, when I look at the analog deadzones diagram, there's a big offset for the center point. That's my picture after pressing the "restore defaults" (and moving the stick doesn't magically centers the rest point):  ![configure evdev_046](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/33661616-0cf34360-da89-11e7-90f9-d2cbc4de1e9c.jpg)      If I press on the filter noise button, it outputs this:  ```  E HLE: Evdev Calibration: Added axis [ 5 = RZ+ ] to blacklist. Value = 127  E HLE: Evdev Calibration: Added axis [ 3 = RX+ ] to blacklist. Value = 127  E HLE: Evdev Calibration: Added axis [ 2 = LZ+ ] to blacklist. Value = 135  E HLE: Evdev Calibration: Added axis [ 1 = LY+ ] to blacklist. Value = 127  E HLE: Evdev Calibration: Added axis [ 0 = LX+ ] to blacklist. Value = 127  ```  which is perfect for registering my buttons, but of course, doesn't allow me to input joystick signals anymore.  Suggestion: a multiselection drop-down box called "Axis Blacklisting" in which we can disable the problematic axis by ticking them instead of the "Filter noise" button.    Hope it's detailled enough to help you.|2017-12-06 12:27:03|toccata10

Well, kind of. Loading a save right before a Trap! error with no shader cache will trigger the error, but not if you have one. The error would disappear in a normal playthrough.  **EDIT/CORRECTION:** Not all occurences of the Trap! error are fixed by this method. This error seems to lose its consistency with time. For example:  - previously, it would always occur when entering Capua Nor  - currently, it can occur one time, then after reloading the game/save, it won't occur immediately (the error occurs a short time later)  Right now, only 100% fixed Trap! errors are the one around the end game boss.    **Eternal Sonata**  Driver crash when going ingame with Zcull enabled is fixed.|2017-11-27 14:57:27|GeniusMage

And this PR is the exact same fix, just with a variable instead of a magic (-1), which already existed.   But I digress, the point is this is what Github comments are for, and this is wrong, especially as commits like this are getting people to pay your Patreon - I just see this as a wrong this to do on your side.|2017-11-18 17:06:31|Farseer2

It isn't the first nor second time I've seen it happen here, and it isn't this specific PR that bothers me, but the principal behind it, the reason I mentioned it now is of1rsa's comment.  And as for this case, it also isn't as if merging this PR was crucial. It is rather minor, and there are lots of PRs sitting for weeks and months without getting merged - this PR itself was open for over 18 hours until getting merged, writing "check for overflow in Linux as well" doesn't take that long.     The bottom line is that I honestly think if someone went through the trouble of debugging, testing, finding the bug, fixing it and creating a PR all in their free time - rewriting it and pushing it to master under your name is disrespectful both towards the programmer and towards yourself and your patreons, not specifically in the context of this PR, but generally speaking.|2017-11-18 19:13:22|Farseer2

If you do want to edit someone's PR though, pretty sure that in Github when someone PRs to your repository you get write permissions to their source branch (by default), so you can leave stuff there - might be wrong, though.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3728|2017-11-12 14:53:31|2017-11-12 18:13:24|I was told that using non shallowed clone would increase build time substantially.    But even not accounting for that, this approach only displays correct commit count for master builds, making it easier to distinguish master builds from non-master builds, which wouldn't happen if we always cloned from unshallowed clones.    If you have a better approach to do that, please PR it. This is what I could do to fix the commit count ASAP under those conditions.|2017-11-12 18:42:50|AniLeo

And in your PR you are doing exactly that, i.e. you fetch the whole thing anyway. The only benefit I see with approach is that PRs still use shallow clone.|2017-11-12 18:56:17|danilaml

I am not sure why that is but since its not reproducible on windows it will be difficult to diagnose right now.    Ni no kuni "regressed" due to how a game bug is being handled. The two options we have are:  1. correct graphics in shaders that only do add/sub with invalid data and black output in shaders using mul/div  2. correct graphics in shaders using mul/div and overbright in shaders that use add and likely garbage where sub is used (less likely)    The only "true" solution is to interpret instructions like we do for CPU stuff (hint: performance hit) or generate dynamic shaders after running variable analysis in the cpu which is a huge task and will add on to the problems we already have with the shader cache so I'll leave it as is for now (with overbright menus in some games to avoid generating NaNs from division by 0)|2017-11-07 09:36:53|kd-11

Vulkan does not like to be used on demand like that as it uses deferred processing of queues and would suffer significant slowdown if resizing of the data is attempted. A compromise is to crop the image read back from the gpu. Always use 100% scaling or openGL for that.  2. The unreleased value can go up quite a bit, as long as memory consumption does not go very high (i.e small textures are occupying the space) its not a big deal. Verify with GPU monitoring tools that VRAM usage is excessive (e.g over 800M VRAM usage)  3. I have pushed an update for the freezing issue with wcb that can happen in some games. Check if the situation has changed. The mechanism can still fail but I feel the majority of cases are properly handled now.    EDIT: Its possible that there is double counting of sections causing the reported value to grow excessively while the real number is quite small. Its also possible that there is excessive invalidation of sections going on. I'll look into what could be causing that to happen|2017-10-27 21:41:11|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3664|2017-10-27 16:20:47|2017-10-28 10:26:19|@Asinin3 Demon's Souls uses cpu readback to only fetch a 16x16 luminance buffer, not actual color data. Thats why the threshold slider is there. At default settings, 16x16 is below the threshold and is not actually scaled. The same goes for any game that uses the readback for anything that is not actual color buffer data.  The cache thrashing issue should be fixed now with https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3664/commits/427df64423a27e71e58d7a9b8c1f98bbbfe7f643.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3664|2017-10-27 16:20:47|2017-10-28 10:26:19|Imo, wcb should not be used with scaling if color data is being written back to the cpu. It will downsample the image to fit in the cpu space and then the image will be stretched again to fit the screen. This usually gives very blurry result due to the upscale->downscale->upscale cycle where information is lost every time. I will however set up a mechanism to scale the output if conditions are right.|2017-10-28 09:17:38|kd-11

Edit: The reason why I use strict mode is that certain game that should not be mentioned by name the character protraits look like this if resolution scale is turned on (any resolution), the only way to fix it is to use strict mode which fixes it.    <img width="647" alt="yosuke gray" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30393444/31801894-a12a286c-b510-11e7-8b0f-39396bc711d1.png">  |2017-10-20 01:55:10|Blacksama

On windows the proprietary driver returns the correct on-box product name like "AMD RX Vega" but radv usually returns internal code names, e.g "AMD PITCAIRN" instead of "R9 200". I'll need a list of mesa device names for RX 460/470/480/550/560/570/580 as well as all Vega.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3611|2017-10-17 07:21:53|2017-11-27 21:31:16|1st: thanks for your work on this subject. It'll be very useful (specially for custom sticks).  It's improving (used to just register a LZ+ with the dragonrise stick).  I try to give you a detailled feedback of my tests:    Test n°1:  xbox360 controller  I clicked on the different gui buttons to register the correct input.  1st thing: for the dpad and the buttons, the countdown stops instantly when I press.  For the analog inputs, it continues to countdown (maybe 2 more seconds) and finally registers the input.    Here's the result:  ![evdev-xbox-correct-but-non-working-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/32413702-a2c56114-c217-11e7-91fc-3a0ca8949ee9.jpg)  I launch Gamepad test:  everything is allright excepted:  left analog stick: when I press right, it goes left (and left gives right). Up and down are not registered at all.  right analog: left and right are correct, but no up & down    Test n°2:  xbox360 controller  When recording the inputs, I swap right and left for the analog sticks:  ![evdev-xbox-working-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/32413704-ad7bd5d4-c217-11e7-8c78-b13bace3557c.jpg)  Everything works fine: up, down, left, right: all is ok.    Test n°3:  DragonRise Inc. Generic USB Joystick (board to create custom sticks)  It's much more difficult to register the inputs: when I press a gui button, it instantly registers the last action (ex: LY+). I've got to repress several times (or wait a few seconds).  Finally, I painfully made it register these inputs:  ![evdev-dragonrise-correct-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/32413705-b50db0e2-c217-11e7-9f91-ce8e7df5d9e3.jpg)    I launch Gamepad test:  everything is allright excepted:  left analog stick: when I press right, it goes left (and left gives right). Up and down are ok. But if I press up, it goes up a bit, then fully (at 0.5s). If I have a little deadzone, it's 1st a big move, then it goes a bit further. If I have a big deadzone, it's 1st a little move, then it moves to the maximum.    Test n°4:  DragonRise Inc. Generic USB Joystick  I tried to swap left and right.  ![evdev-dragonrise-reversed-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/32413707-b9330884-c217-11e7-82c9-93f258af7ad8.jpg)  left analog stick: when I press right, it goes right (fine!).

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3611|2017-10-17 07:21:53|2017-11-27 21:31:16|For now the button mapping in evdev is still a bit laggy for the sticks.  We decided to keep it that way for now, since it presents an improvement to not having the option at all.  If it doesn't work you can still manually enter the buttons in the yml like before.  And since you are able to remap the default left and right should not be of big concern (also it was decided by hcorion and I , since our controller seem fine with those defaults)    Maybe in future PRs people can change the defaults depending on detected controller type.    The not working y axis is quite troublesome, but I can't reproduce with my own xbox 360 controller.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3611|2017-10-17 07:21:53|2017-11-27 21:31:16|you have to increase the deadzones or thresholds.  your controller sends small signals even if you don't move it. that's why the buttons are being mapped to the u- axis. when you increase the deadzone it will filter out these small movements.  You can see the received signals by enabling log level notice in the log section of rpcs3 (rightclick on the log to open the context menu).  I suspect you constantly have something like: "mmjoy button U- pressed with value: 5".    For now I have no plan for making the value visible in the gui. soyou have to adjust to these minor inconveniences|2017-10-27 10:36:30|Megamouse

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3611|2017-10-17 07:21:53|2017-11-27 21:31:16|ahhh... strange..   I never had this issue with any other emulator.. not one...  - ZSNES, KegaFusion, ePSXe, PCSX2, Higan, BizHawk, PJ64, etc..    :P ;-)   anyway... as my old PS2 DS2 died.. ie only one to three buttons were still working... at all..  SO I bought a brand new still in original Sony packaging PS2 DS2 off of eBay over the weekend and got it in the mail yesterday.    so "new" lol :P     hmm.. I tried adjusting the deadzones that seemed to help for all but the Joystick axis..   RPCS3 was not responding to or allowing mapping to those axis.. so I left them on there default value..  but the mappings of my PS2 controller did have different buttons #s from what is set as default..  lol ;-) XD    ps: the deadzone sliders could use some TOOL-TIP popups with more detailed info as to what they actually do... lol ;p  and.. its one thing considering the PS2 controller has only buttons and joy and no triggers...   with one set of deadzone sliders set to max.. the detected button went from..  Joy deadzones maxed but TRIGGER deadzones at 0 = Z+ (ie. R2 button)  TRIGGER deadzones maxed but JOY deadzones at 0 = U- (RIGHT-Joystick, left direction)    if all deadzones are maxed..   all buttons register..   EXCEPT the Joystick directions,   MEH! xD      ps2:  off I see it now the U- is default for LEFT on the RIGHT-JOYSTICK...  strange it should be sending signals,, this a BRAND NEW controller so there isn't any worn-ness in any one direction for the joysticks.. strange...    Here are my mapping pics.. first mine and then the defaults for comparison..         here is the log entries you were mentioning... O_O  strange..   the diagnostics usually treat them as... value of 0 for OFF, and value of 1 for pressed..  I have tested with the Windows game controller tester as well as this one  [http://html5gamepad.com/](url)  this website says there is a AXIS 0 with a constant value of 1 [ON/PRESSED]  AXIS 0 is NOT any of the joypad buttons or the two joysticks  left    joystick is: axis 1 = left(X-)/right(X+)   and axis 2 = up(Y+)/down(Y-)  right joystick is: axis 3 = left(U-)/right(U+)   and axis 4 = up(R+)/down(R-)      - HLE: GetNextButtonPress: mmjoystick button U- pressed with value 255  - HLE: GetNextButtonPress: mmjoystick button X- pressed with value 255    plus others.. like Z  and spammed a LOT in the log,...    |2017-10-27 11:08:41|MelchiorGaspar

Sometimes, a developer on Windows would break the Appveyor build because usually his changes are only tested on VS (I did that once). Running VS on Appveyor makes sure that what was tested in the developers machine end up on the Appveyor.     With this problem solved, there's still a lot of windows-specific hacks on CMake files that makes it overly complex. Wouldn't be better just to deprecate this build and remove CMake on windows altogether? This would make it easier to maintain the files. What do others think?|2017-11-13 16:55:50|henriquenj

It's not a mesa bug, it's an issue with the way LLVM works. This has nothing to do with the "primitive restart" you mentioned.    I didn't say that it has something to do with "primitive restart", I've linked Mesa/DRI driver loading bug in FreeDesktop. "primitive restart" part was about how instead of making assumptions and permanent workarounds it would be better to ask driver developers directly if you have to. Let them fix these things for everyone. In fact, it's their job, there is paid AMD, Intel, Red Hat, HP, etc. staff in there.    > Looking at the OpenSUSE build, it has this CMake flag, -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=" (llvm-config --libs mcjit vectorize ipo x86codegen x86disassembler)", have you tried removing that?    That's the first thing I did. It's just adds '-lLLVM', I think. But all those "LLVMCore, etc." files simply don't exist in openSUSE. Nothing short of removing ''llvm_map_components_to_libnames" helped. Strangely, these files were mentioned in my 'locate' database, meaning that may have been removed on LLVM update to 4.0.1. In fact, in [update changelog](https://build.opensuse.org/package/rdiff/openSUSE:Factory/llvm4?linkrev=base&rev=9) I see this:  "Tue Oct 10 12:14:31 UTC 2017 - msrb@suse.com  - Drop llvm4-devel-static. llvm4-devel contains shared library with the same content."    But they also fixed [that loading bug](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-LoaderAndValidationLayers/issues/1978) which I [linked earlier](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99591). So maybe that resolved your issue with linking or something similar could be done. Otherwise someone will have to convince openSUSE maintainers revert their change just to keep things weird like that which is almost impossible since they are the stubbornest.    > I'm pretty sure hidapi links statically against RPCS3.    I would think so and there are line in build log like '… -lGL ../3rdparty/hidapi/linux/libhidapi-hidraw.so -ludev -ldl -lpthread -lz -lrt -lX11 -lasound -lpulse-simple -lpulse -levdev -lvulkan -lavformat -lavcodec -lavutil -lswresample -lswscale -lpng -lz /usr/lib64/libLLVM.so.4.0.1 …' but OBS seems to be insistent on adding 'libhidapi-hidraw.so()(64bit)' as requirement that can't be installed. Which is weird, since such file exist, but as a link to 'libhidapi-hidraw.so.0.0.0' (actual binary from 'libhidapi-hidraw0') in package 'libhidapi-devel'. Maybe it's better to remove system libhidapi from [my build](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:X0F:branches:Emulators/rpcs3) and see if it helps it to not be confused.  |2017-10-24 13:30:23|v-fox

I've managed to remove openSUSE's default cmake and compiler options, then it linked properly with static version without adding non-existent dependencies.

Dolphin, for example, uses offline ini DB, which also stores best compat options.    So, another approach, without creating such db in the repo,  would probably be to generate something like this in the appveyor when creating an artifact/build. I.e., where could be some compat. db generated from the website stored locally that rpcs3 will use to display compat. ratings. This has the benefit of the DB being a snapshot of compat. at the time of the build creation (so there shouldn't be any worries regarding a user using older build but seeing the higher compat. for a newer version).|2017-10-03 16:50:21|danilaml

In case you decided that simple compat. rating is worth the hassle, you'd probably need to adjust the cmake script to copy OpenSSL to the bin dir on windows (appveyor already has OpenSSL installed). The devs would manage to install it themselves (or ignore it).    Or you could just use something like http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsslsocket.html#supportsSsl (maybe there is something better) to test whether the openSSL lib was found on the user's PC and prompt him to install it manually or place it near rpcs3 exe if he wants to enable ratings (and disable them otherwise).|2017-10-04 00:20:27|danilaml

The db could be even provided as a big json by the rpcs3.net, so rpcs3 would just look for it and parse it with no internet communication. Compat. db is not that important thing and doesn't change so often that'd it warrant an internet request to the rpcs3 web server every time someone launches rpcs3/updates the list.

I used to have to keep audio at 3 / 100, now it's 60/100 and at a comfortable level.    getting a little scary here, i unfortunately did not test trails of cold steel 2 on Vulkan in your last update, since the first time i tried to use vulkan with TOCS2 it was very slow.  Now i'm getting perfectly stable framerates everywhere, the lighting issue in battles is fixed, haven't run into any texture corruption since being in and out of the menu multiple times.  I'm sure something will crop up sooner or later, but this is amazing.    ![tocs2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15056246/30767571-34209bf0-9fc3-11e7-8521-f4566e4fb731.PNG)    [RPCS3.log.gz](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/files/1326113/RPCS3.log.gz)    ------    found some texture corruption and when it happened again the same way i closed down the emulator.  happened whenever characters are talking to each other, a window overlay pops up on the lower right side of the screen.

[RPCS3.log.gz](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/files/1326152/RPCS3.log.gz)    --------    Update: got to the first Terra Shrine, Vulkan fps dropped down to about 18 fps, the area is saturated with particles, lots of gas type clouds and sparkly things floating around.  decided to switch over to openGL, fps improved to around 22 fps or so, but so far (around 1 hour in game) i haven't seen any texture corruption, no whited-out enemies or npc's, no black face or dark textures, no stretched out textures replacing avatars, nothing.  While vulkan seems to play smoother even at a slightly lower fps, it still had the weird texture corruption but was limited to what it would show up on.   I'm hoping OpenGL continues to have no texture corruption outside of this dungeon.      ![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15056246/30770061-6d711b9a-9fec-11e7-963d-c8e24e1f9c8d.PNG)  ----------  finally found one about 15 min outside the Terra Shrine, wasn't major, just took the image from a battle enemy and replaced some overlay on the level up screen.

You can query it's location from `qmake` and I think you get `qmake` location from `find_package`. I saw several CMake scripts do that. Or you can just don't include that part in the cmake and add it to the appveyor script (similar to how `linuxdeployqt` is used on travis).|2017-09-10 22:23:07|danilaml

However I managed to use it locally from the windows CMD and it seems to do the job. It somehow found all the DLL files that were needed by just looking at the compiled rpcs3.exe.    The only thing different is that it actually copies more files than we actually needed it. So I'll keep the current CMake solution for now.

So, I don't think there's an O(1) solution everywhere without multiple maps. Forward_lists would probably be better for how I'm using it.  But, again, so far all games tested only page fault from one thread and have only one thing being notified-- there isn't much point to optimizing data structures while n=1.    I didn't know about std::find_if, but it isn't being used anywhere else in rpcs3's codebase.

Its the former of this statement, not the latter. Silent hill depends on the idea that when gyro is enabled, more often than not, it will receive new data, which is completely wrong on their part.    Always reporting non 0 length will cause issues with other games that are coded differently, like for example 'Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix' will hang on boot now because its expecting a 0 length value.    https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/632692-silent-hill-hd-collection/62302779 , the game has controller problems on an *actual* ps3  |2017-08-21 22:13:18|jarveson
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3291|2017-08-21 15:19:35|2017-09-28 09:15:55|I can only say that my tests show that there is always "length = 24" data in the buffer even if nothing changes (including gyro data) if the gyro is enabled. Turns out my second controller has a much lower jitter and can actually produce the same values for both analog sticks and the gyro indefinitetly. Still I never get a "length = 0" reply.    Enabling the gyro and then waiting for a 0 packet seems like a game bug to me and should definitely not work at all from what I can see. Maybe some other function that the game calls actually resets the controller input and that is not correctly emulated?|2017-08-22 06:30:46|jjsat
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3291|2017-08-21 15:19:35|2017-09-28 09:15:55|How often is ur test calling cellPadGetData?

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3291|2017-08-21 15:19:35|2017-09-28 09:15:55|I see. My test calls it once per frame, so there is some pause between calls. But still the "new data" flagging is not triggered by the data changing because the data is the same for every call.    It could of course be possible that the flagging for new data is done with higher precision data before converting the gyro range to 0-255. Or maybe new data is delayed by time.|2017-08-26 10:34:08|jjsat
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3291|2017-08-21 15:19:35|2017-09-28 09:15:55|After reviewing the information from this: http://games.soc.napier.ac.uk/resources/ps3_tutorial_003.pdf (it is archived on the wayback machine) it is clear that _always_ returning non-0 data is wrong. That tutorial claims that the minimum time between pad updates is about 10 ms, so probably limited by the packet rate from the controller. So a more correct behaviour for the gyro mode might be returning updated data every time the last call to the function was >= 10 ms ago. Still not quite correct as the updating is asynchronous to the call but maybe close enough.    e: As to why SH has controller issues on a real PS3? Not sure, but a broken gyro in the controller might prevent the controller from sending new packets?|2017-08-27 10:39:59|jjsat

Just noticed that this only works as intended for one controller though :-/    Seems to close to what a PS3 does. I noticed that also other games have issues with the controller, e.g. in Wolfenstein every time a button must be held down for an action, it retriggers after a short time as if the button was let go with the current code.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3283|2017-08-20 15:11:54|2017-09-08 23:55:04|Nice improvement. A few tests with evdev (linux):  1. I launch rpcs3, and configure my pads like this for 2 players:  ![gamepads settings_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/29656504-e81dc31a-88b4-11e7-8d61-0660d58962e1.jpg)  I click ok: it works.  2. I open again the gamepad config:  ![gamepads settings_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/29656508-ea08765c-88b4-11e7-9535-df413b6285b8.jpg)  It attributes the same device to player 1 and 2    Suggestions:  1. When there are several devices, give the lowest to the 1st player, then another one for player 2, ...  2. If player 1 and player 2 are configured with evdev, but only 1 device is found, disable input for player 2: it doesn't make sense to me to have the same joystick controlling 2 different players. With Castle crashers for example, if I want to play alone, I plug 1 controller. If I want to play with a friend, I plug 2 controllers. It should work without having to re-open the pad config. With the present code, if I plug only 1 joystick, it'll create and control 2 players. Some games (street fighter HD remix) don't allow the same controller to play 2 fighters, but it's not universal.    |2017-08-24 08:30:23|toccata10

And there is no way to disable it on GCC (they "forgot" to add that option and it was only recently updated on their bug tracker).    Regarding operator precedence, I haven't touched them since some of them looked like a legit bug, so I'd rather the devs that worked on that modules to look at them. For example in cellPad.cpp `std::min(data->len / 2, 15) & 0xF` doesn't make sense, since the value of min will always be <= 15 (and I doubt that len could be negative, but who knows? That's why I haven't touched it).|2017-08-17 03:12:04|danilaml

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3246|2017-08-16 22:49:31|2017-08-18 20:09:53|I disagree, if its not static then its clear it can be used extern anywhere else. If its static then it can't be used extern anywhere else.     This not idiomatic usage at all thats why there is a compiler warning, it looks like a mistake.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3246|2017-08-16 22:49:31|2017-08-18 20:09:53|Yeah I get you, but its not idiomatic C++, the thinking should be this:    All globals are intended to be used else where unless they are marked static or contained in an anonymous namespace.    Otherwise `int foo = 5;` appears to not be intended to be used else where no? But it can be because it isn't `static int foo = 5;`. Also the use of extern like that is not consistent with all of the other true globals in the code base.  |2017-08-17 17:16:21|paulsapps

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/3244|2017-08-16 22:01:45|2017-08-19 17:05:34|I think I know the problem. The `JOYSTICK_BUSTYPE` macro is actually just [`BUS_USB`](http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/v4.6/source/include/uapi/linux/input.h#L231), so all USB devices are getting picked up as joysticks.    A "proper" solution would be to use libudev, which invokes callbacks with arguments that can be used to determine if the input device is a joystick (it would also add room for hot plugging). However, as a temporary fix, we could [mimic what SDL does](https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror/blob/master/src/joystick/linux/SDL_sysjoystick.c#L182-L195). Off the top of my head, I think a libevdev equivalent would be:    ```  if (libevdev_has_event_type(dev, EV_KEY) &&      libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_ABS, ABS_X) &&      libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_ABS, ABS_Y))  {      // It's a joystick.  }  ```|2017-08-18 14:06:54|refi64

Some suggestions:    I wouldn't make such a narrow list the maximum screen height, it looks ugly to me. I'd keep it to ~10-15 items by default and let the user resize it and save their settings. But if you insist, you'll need to take the Windows taskbar into account. Currently the Close button part appears behind the taskbar.    Also, there's not enough extra information to warrant a separate Info window. It should be a panel in the list window.

So, for now, I'm just going to leave it, not ideal as I agree it is.    I'll probably add icons once I figure out a good size for them.

I tested Catherine. On master build it runs flawlessly on my configuration (Core i7-6700K + GTX 1070), but on this PR shader cache stuttering is very annoying. It happens everytime I enter a new location or a new cutscene and makes shader cache system absolutely unwanted for my configuration.

I'll open a tracker for immediate rendering after merging this since its getting too large to effectively track regresssions. Its originally 54 commits.  @Xcedf  How is it slower? stuttering or smooth lower fps? Depending on how frame-to-frame timings vary it could be anything. The commit you pointed to moves load to the GPU which makes every other game faster so its wierd that its slower for you.

Its nice, but it will be a while before thats done if at all. We cant know where to get the shader data or how they will be used before they are used, so thats a problem. Vulkan has heavier compilation penalties than openGL so if all else fails, fall back to GL. It also has less state permitations than vulkan, and performance is pretty much identical now anyway.|2017-08-16 19:57:53|kd-11

We are in alpha expect things to break until they get fixed again, it's not worth the dev-time making a work-around for something that will be resolved in the future.    There is some major problems with the shader cache at the moment where it generates too many shaders for a game or repeatedly generates the same shaders over and over. When this is resolved the performance should be good again, if there is some other reason to disable the cache that can't be resolved then it may be worth the time however...|2017-08-20 07:55:51|Asinin3

This would improve smoothness at the cost of increased frame latency.

There are no (intentional) changes to any of the output code. If vertex attribute switching caused the regression, it should be resolved with the next PR.

There is some odd behavior with how the game configuration is read.  e.g. If you have the PS3_GAME (i.e. contents of disc) under /dev_hdd0/disc/BLES00296/  And if you have the USRDIR folder with EBOOT.BIN for that game under /dev_hdd0/game/BLES00296/  When you boot from the game list, the global config.yml is used instead of the game config.yml under data/BLES00296/config.yml    This is how the Title in the GSframe looks and the configuration is read from the config.yml from the root folder instead of the per game config.yml stored in /data/(Game Title)    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28158623/28149501-0905da42-675c-11e7-9078-1d8d3833fa9e.png)    |2017-07-13 03:47:52|raveskirza

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|I finally found the time to take a look at this.    I tested it with a PS3 controller connected via USB:  - The button mapping was wrong, which is to be expected, as the PS3 controller just maps the buttons linearly, so I wrote my own mapping file: [gist](https://gist.github.com/MonokelPinguin/564ab06665a810426e4053b708079e45)  - After that input was really laggy (10 Seconds for each button press), so I reduced the sleep interval and changed the button mapping form vector<vector<int>> to vector<unordered_map<int>>  - Currently the digital buttons can't be remapped, so I added that.    With those modifications the controller seemed to work really well. I also tried to remove the sleep and instead use select/poll, but they both increased latency by ~0.5 Seconds, which I felt wasn't acceptable. I pushed my changes to my [fork](https://github.com/MonokelPinguin/rpcs3/tree/evdev), if you want to have a look.    Currently integration with the controller remapping dialogue and rumble/button axes are still missing, but that can be done later. Well done!|2017-07-10 21:17:42|deepbluev7
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|@MonokelPinguin: I tried your fork with a custom stick  DragonRise Inc.   Generic   USB  Joystick   (/dev/input/js0)  2 problems:  1) Although I created a config_linuxjoystick.yml in my .config/rpcs3 folder, the buttons are wrongly mapped (I used the kde joystick utility to detect the correct button number). For example, I have to press "select" instead of "start", and so on. So buttons are working but are not correctly mapped.  2) I can't figure how to declare the axis for the d-pad (no analog stick on my device).    Lastly, when I press (and release) a button, I've got this on the log:  E Unknown joystick #0 event 4  E Unknown joystick #0 event 4  |2017-07-11 07:33:56|toccata10
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|@toccata10    1. In my case the button order is exactly the same as in the joystick kcm. Does anything change if you swap button mappings after you tested the buttons? I.e map what was select to start. Also did you restart rpcs3 after creating the config and does the mapping change if you remove it?    2. You should be able to map axes with "Right stick - X axis" and so on, although I didn't fiddle with that. Although you currently can only map to the left and right stick axes, not the trigger, dpad, symbol buttons etc, that the original PS3 controller has on almost every button.    The unknown joystick event 4 is EV_MSC, which can be ignored. I get that too and we probably should remove that log message for EV_MSC. Basically some controllers emit this event additionally to the normal button events for every button press and it contains the key code of the pressed button. I still don't know, what the intended use is, but we don't need it.|2017-07-11 08:30:57|deepbluev7
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|So, I finally realized that there's an offset:  in kde, the 1st button (the square) is reported as number 1. In the config file, it has to be reported as number 0.  This way, I was able to have my buttons work (and they seem to respond very quickly).    I then tried to have the d-pad working. Putting this in the config file results in a bad behaviour (rpcs3 becomes slow and freezes when I touch the stick).  Left stick - X axis: 0  Left stick - Y axis: 1    So, I removed this and saw that my X and Y axis for the d-pad were swapped (normal on my custom stick which is rotated by 90°). To make them correct, I tried to modify the   evdev/rpcs3/evdev_joystick_handler.cpp  line 29 was:  enum { DPAD_AXIS_X = -1, DPAD_AXIS_Y = -2 };  I changed it to  enum { DPAD_AXIS_X = -2, DPAD_AXIS_Y = -1 };  No change.    I tried also a xbox360 controller. I was able to remap the buttons, but the axis are completely wrong.  The config_linuxjoystick.yml is:  ```  Start: 7  Select: 6  L1: 4  R1: 5  Triangle: 3  Circle: 1  Cross: 0  Square: 2  ```  |2017-07-11 12:55:48|toccata10
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|So I had a look at the axis remapping code:  Currently it works in a way, that you can only swap around the first 4 axes. So you have to remap all 4 axes or you will get duplicate mappings. I can't say why it froze rpcs3 in your case though. Maybe you can set the log to Notice and see if anything is obvious.    I don't know though, if you can remap your dpad to a stick in the way you imagine. A stick only has 2 axes, I'd imagine your pad has one for every dpad button?|2017-07-11 14:37:37|deepbluev7
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|To make things clearer, this is what I have when I press my custom joystick: left, up, right, down. When pressing "left", by default, I have a "up" (because my axis are rotated). What I need, is a way to declare that my horizontal axis is "y" and my vertical axis is "x" (and probably, for greater flexibility, a way to declare that those axis could be reversed).  ![joystick configuration du systeme_272](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/28079479-e16e12b8-6668-11e7-9362-1aa2d3b5a0ef.png)  Pressing "up", gives me a "right" signal by default:  ![joystick configuration du systeme_273](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/28079481-e327bc3a-6668-11e7-85c0-950917a7e3bf.png)  ![joystick configuration du systeme_274](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/28079482-e4ea83ea-6668-11e7-823b-f7124079836e.png)  ![joystick configuration du systeme_275](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7478580/28079485-e6a284e4-6668-11e7-976e-72d18cddffad.png)  |2017-07-11 16:50:05|toccata10

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2885|2017-06-17 18:21:33|2017-07-26 18:03:07|Works fine from my little testing: snappy response, the axes are now correct, no crashes (but maybe I didn't test long enough).  Suggestions: in the WIP guide, something like:  `evtest /dev/input/by-id/my-joystick   grep KEY`  code 288 is for button 0  code 299 is for button 1    and    Remapping axes is possible. For example, for a custom arcade stick with axes 90° rotated:  ```Left stick X axis: 3  Left stick Y axis: 2  Reverse left stick X axis: true  Axis scaling: false  ```    And/or give my config as an example: for a custom fighting stick made with a DragonRise_Inc._Generic, here'a another example configuration:  ```  Start: 5  Select: 6  L2: 10  R2: 11  L1: 3  R1: 4  Triangle: 7  Circle: 2  Cross: 1  Square: 0  Axis scaling: false  Left stick X axis: 3  Left stick Y axis: 2  Reverse left stick X axis: true  ```    Well done !  I was wondering if it was difficult to add the 2nd player input (with evdev) ? It's done on windows with Xinput: you can have 2 local players. That would bring the linux version to feature parity with windows, and fighting games are so much more fun with a friend !|2017-07-20 06:45:33|toccata10

The joystick is recognized as an analog input, which is often fine. Except on a few games (ex: Dragon's lair, Chaos code): these games are only accepting D-pad input.  In retroarch, they have an "Analog to Digital Type" which can have 3 values: none, left or right.  That's very convenient for custom sticks.  So, my humble request: is it possible to add a parameter in the config_linuxjoystick.yml which could be:  `Analog to Digital Type`  Or:  `Dpad=Left stick`  This would duplicate the input on both the analog and digital  Or:  `Dpad=Left stick digital only`  which would desactivate analog input and just keep the dpad inputs  |2017-07-28 07:50:54|toccata10

Only a couple things..    1) Small nitpick. const QString& instead of const QString& for small efficiency boost of not copying parameters each time.    2)  I haven't thought too hard, but would QActionGroup work better than QLisf<QAction*>?     I think the method layout as is is fine. Makes it fairly close what the code is doing.

Edit: I just checked and travis/appveyor are actually building with Qt 5.9 which is not provided by the ubuntu package. Maybe ubuntu users have to manually install a higher version of Qt (the package provides 5.7.1 for the newest ubuntu version).  Is there a minimum version of Qt required?|2017-06-06 19:45:31|Areiser

Also, we'll need to combine both the vulkan device selection dropdown and the DX12 device selection dropdown since having two separate controls with generally the same information is wasteful. This requires proper callbacks to be set up, but that can be done later.  Also of worth noting is that on systems without vulkan loader installed properly, this will crash the settings dialog, making it impossible to configure rpcs3 on such systems without manually editing the config file. There are ways around that of course, but still unimplemented.  Overall, the implementation is minimal and would be perfect if not for the issue of completely locking users out of the settings dialog.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2782|2017-05-14 05:15:14|2017-05-18 11:22:46|Thanks @SakataGintokiYT for pointing out that commit.    @jarveson I see we've duplicated some work here, and I've been looking at your changes, which are very similar to mine. I noticed you start calling `InterpreterCall(op);` every once and a while, I'm wondering why that was.    Also, you've replaced the ASMJIT bug workaround, with:  ```cpp  X86Gp cpu_var = compiler.gpz(X86Gp::kIdR12);  X86Gp ls_var = compiler.gpz(X86Gp::kIdR13);  ```  I'm wondering how much of a difference that makes, and what the absence of setArg will do.    You also changed the qw0-2 and addr vars to   ```cpp  // win64 specific  X86Gp addr_var = compiler.zax().r32();  X86Gp qw0_var  = compiler.zcx();  X86Gp qw1_var  = compiler.zdx();  X86Gp qw2_var  = compiler.gpz(X86Gp::kIdR8);  ```  I developed my code on Linux, in what way is your code win64 specific?  I'm also not sure what your doing with the FuncFrameInfo, and whether the ASMJIT error handler is worth the effort.    I would appreciate you reviewing my changes as well.|2017-05-14 05:54:41|hcorion
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2782|2017-05-14 05:15:14|2017-05-18 11:22:46|Awesome work on getting asmjit updated!   So the things you mentioned from my branch was because i was attempting to use the 'assembler' part of asmjit rather than the 'compiler' feature which is used currently, because i wanted to see if there was a difference in jit compile time, which, unfortunately, really didnt seem to make a noticeable difference during my testing, which is why the branch was left stale heh    In the assembler mode you choose and allocate registers manually, and the lines you mentioned was me just using cherry picked registers that are volatile/non-volatile/parameters on win64 calling convention. Another downside of the assembler mode is you cant use other nice features such as `XmmConst` which is why there are random `InterpreterCall(op);` littered about as i was lazy and just wanted to get a quick concept. So the code is heavily win specific, but can mostly be ignored as the 'compiler' version, which youve kept, will (should) adapt to whatever it is called on    As for your other questions, FuncFrameInfo can be ignored as its more 'assembler' specific, and the errorhandler, while nice, is only really helpful when asmjit fails to compile the code, which i dont think has ever happened so far.    Otherwise, looking at your code changes, functionaly it should be the same, barring any bugs/fixes in asmjit.    This kinda turned into a wall of text, but hope it helps, or let me know if something seems wrong/off/needs clarification  |2017-05-14 08:09:30|jarveson

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2733|2017-04-26 03:52:23|2017-05-04 20:35:10|^ Yea, i don't have a ds3 and the protocol is different enough that it would have to be looked into separately    Regarding the submodule, the hidapi repo itself is fairly stable and doesnt look to be updated that often so i doubt there will be any actual major changes to deal with. You're right in that the cmake / vs files could be pulled out but i think having the whole nested folders / double folder to deal with it is worse and just adds clutter    Anyway, i've forked the repo and committed the changes needed to hidapi, https://github.com/jarveson/hidapi , if you want to fork/clone this under rpcs3 team repos ill make the appropriate changes to this PR to use it as a submodule, or however you want to do it|2017-04-26 17:39:37|jarveson

It's a bit less elegant, yes. But certainly better, than just plain pasting the whole folder (just look at the PR diff...). Though just using the fork for the submodule seems to be the cleanest solution and easiest to deal with, provided we don't need to update it often.|2017-04-26 19:17:25|danilaml

If you're really serious about learning to program, find some online tutorials, I'd recommend the python programming language: https://www.learnpython.org/     but please don't reply to this message, we've all got our own lives to attend to, and most of us don't have the time to devote to helping you learn programming. |2017-04-19 22:30:15|hcorion

Yes I know that DX12 != D3D and I don't care. This is easier for people.     Moreover, also rename the menu option "PAD Settings" to "Keyboard settings".

Keyboard settings, because it only works with pad handler set to keyboard.

We haven't finalized Qt's version for RPCS3 (or I haven't been told one yet), but 5.8 works for me.    1) Open rpcs3.sln in visual studio  2) Assuming you have Qt visual studio plugin installed, go to QT5->Open Project File (.pro)  3) Navigate to rpcs3/rpcs3qt and select the qt .pro file.   4) Right click the now uploaded project rpcs3qt, and click "Set as Startup Project"    From there, you can build as normally.

The only thing I can see is that .find can be changed into .rfind. It runs all the same correctness checks as the old code, and checks g_cfg_vfs_dev_bdvd is a directory in addition. Maybe you want an error message if the value of g_cfg_vfs_dev_bdvd is not valid?|2017-03-26 11:57:16|cornytrace

Might I ask which references you used for this? I was still looking around for good docs on the chip.  Since image_in downloads images from rendered targets at times, but does not scale them, I was wondering if image rescaling is actually necessary when downloading render targets. I guess more tests will be needed.    @SakataGintokiYT Does this PR fix games like Bakugan as well? Or do those still show a black screen?|2017-02-18 08:33:05|kd-11

I'm not sure how AMD hybrid works though and I have no way of testing it, so if someone can please test.     Just boot current master without picking a GPU and see if RSX shows Intel or AMD, then boot this one and seek for the same output.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2391|2017-02-15 10:54:34|2017-03-01 07:36:04|A few issues I've encountered so far:  1. ~~Seems like sometimes the game is using only part of a tile as a resource which implies that some kind of offset into the tile might be expected when rendering. I have not been able to find this parameter yet within the tile information, but its possible i'm overlooking something trivial. For now, I'm filling the whole tile with the data which gives inconsistent results.~~  RESOLVED: Probably just using a section from an framebuffer during texture upload. Might invalidate the scaling requirement below, fixing both issues.  2. GPU scaling of textures is non-trivial for DX12 and opengl requiring extra render-passes which causes fallback to CPU scaling which sucks.|2017-02-15 10:57:17|kd-11

If old hardware implements an extension, it works the same as when it is made part of core (no EXT/ARB suffix). Even older terascale AMD supports this extension via GL 4.3.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2259|2017-01-07 21:04:26|2017-01-20 02:48:17|It is so that the pointers do not point to invalid_method, which crashes the RSX.  So yeah it implements nothing, it just stubs it out, just as the lines above and below it.|2017-01-10 13:01:16|cornytrace

POLYGON_STIPPLE_PATTERN has an address range of 32 (520h to 540h; see gcm_enums.h) and the implementation of bind_array does a for loop setting the next count methods to the implementation pointer.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2234|2016-12-05 17:40:08|2016-12-15 11:34:30|No, that's not the case. The reason why you get ILLEGAL_CONFIGURATION is because I limited available configurations to the only one user selected in options. If the game doesn't like the only available option it just doesn't know what to choose. For example, in your case it doesn't like 1080p so it tries 720p even though it is not an available option. If aspect ratio and resolution don't mach it will send VIDEO_RESOLUTION_UNDEFINED instead.  Anyway, game does start up ignoring ILLEGAL_CONFIGURATION error it seems. It doesn't show anything because of broken cellGcmSetFlipImmediate which I am working on now|2016-12-06 13:46:49|itmo153277

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2156|2016-09-26 03:30:21|2016-09-26 13:59:38|Yes. I see the problem - there is no operation returned when comparison is never. That is why I suggested just  `if (never) return {}` or `if (never) return ""` Either will prevent the last part from being executed since there is no logical operation for never/always comparison  The PR is actually okay as is by the way, I was just requesting that references to never and always are kept to help others reading the code understand why they were dealt with like this. |2016-09-26 12:35:01|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2112|2016-08-28 18:21:01|2016-09-17 21:53:59|I don't really understand these format tweaks, UseTab must be ForIndentation as it was already used (with discussible move to spaces in future, but not the opposite). Automatically enforcing clang-format currently doesn't make sense because the tool is broken one or another way, and correctly supports (it seems so) only its default style. I installed VS plugin and prefer to manually apply it to selected fragments of code if necessary, like for formatting enum constant lists. If it breaks something or code becomes ugly, the best approach is to avoid autoformatting at all. |2016-08-28 20:52:41|Nekotekina
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2112|2016-08-28 18:21:01|2016-09-17 21:53:59|Issue is that it's hard to define rpcs3 coding style in term of clang-format style option. It looks like clang-format doesn't support tab as well as spaces. I'm getting mixed tabs-spaces at line continuation because clang-format uses tab for indentation and then spaces (continuationIndentWidth). Using always for tab + tabWidth matching continuationIndentWidth turns the spaces into tab. Unfortunatly others space sequences may be replaced with tabs... Otherwise clang-format works well for me with the command line ; I once used the visual studio plugin but for some reasons it ignored the settings in the .clang-format file even with the "file" style set in the options. The hook is only active if moved in .git/hooks and without the extension ; the file in the directory doesn't activate it automatically. I added the file just for reference since all the solutions I found with google doesn't handle the non staged change properly or just abort commit if style is wrong. |2016-08-28 21:37:19|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2083|2016-08-21 14:53:46|2016-08-23 00:24:23|I'll have to figure out what caused the heuristic to fail. This changeset is similar to eliminating the fallback paths in case only one output was set whilst front_back_enabled was also set. This means (since the variable renaming condition is a bit more lax) there are cases where the variable spec_color or diff_color is used without being defined and the shader compiler is ignoring this somehow. I'll take a look when I can, hopefully very soon. |2016-08-23 14:25:13|kd-11

I think It was reliably reproducible in some games after pausing for a long time and then unpausing.  P.S. Just saw that you've came to the same conclusion. So it's more like a bug in our implementation, rather than XAudio itself.  |2016-08-06 15:45:32|danilaml

Here, [found it](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee419230%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):   ``` XAUDIO2_MAX_QUEUED_BUFFERS Maximum buffers allowed in a voice queue. ``` |2016-08-06 16:06:00|danilaml
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2038|2016-08-06 15:22:53|2016-08-06 15:43:33|It's obvious that the queue has some internal size. But it still doesn't mean I can't submit more. Of course, they may be discarded in this case. 2.7 is wrong because it crashes without even trying to recover (it should be easy to detect internally rather than explicitly checking it as I did). It could theoretically return the error code, but I don't see anything like this specified. IXAudio2SourceVoice::SubmitSourceBuffer method doesn't say much too. ~~That's why I assume that discarding excessive buffers is right.~~ No, it's not absolutely right, but rpcs3 having a bug doesn't discard other bugs. |2016-08-06 16:49:06|Nekotekina

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2021|2016-08-03 17:38:54|2016-08-05 16:08:03|Okay, after taking a better look it should work quite well. Maybe I was just tired, but my initial understanding of it was flawed. I'm not sure what caused the tetris regressions though; it may have been broken before this. Hitman2 no longer boots on rpcs3.  Should be okay then, although the selection of primitive types to selectively expand bothers me a bit. e.g upload_untouched on quad_strip. |2016-08-04 07:40:08|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/2005|2016-07-31 08:16:15|2016-07-31 16:45:07|Anyway if you want to make it less sparse (which is insignificant in my opinion, but hypothetically), `std::unordered_map` is questionable choice, it's compex and tweaking hash may not be enough.

I just call `fs::create_path()` to ensure the shaderlog folder exists, because it doesn't gets created when deleted. In Linux and Mac this folder usually doesn't exists in the config directory (`fs::get_config_dir()`), only on Windows because its part of the repository and the config directory is the binary location at the moment. I'm not sure if this is the best location for the call tho :confused:   Regarding this issue you could try to trace the application. On Unices `strace` is the way to go.

Bit i is set if and only if the memory type i in the VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure for the physical device is supported for the resource.  Unfortunately this goes against what we have been doing for image memory. We have been assuming that type bits will match memory type. NV approach to this is actually rather interesting. I'm pushing a fix for this. It seems the property flags in the table dont mean anything for images.  EDIT: Actually, both the type property flags and the memory block type bits are used. This can be quite confusing, but it makes sense when you take a closer look. |2016-07-24 15:40:08|kd-11

I can fix it on all backends including DX12 by forcefully clearing depth after a buffer invalidation (prepare_render_targets), but I think a better mechanism is needed than that.  @vlj Are buffer contents considered invalid after m_rtts_dirty is set? If so, we should always clear the buffers before reusing them (at least for depth buffers) |2016-07-20 20:33:12|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1957|2016-07-20 20:18:10|2016-07-21 23:31:58|Is there a command dump ? m_rtts_dirty is set when surface format/offset/... is changed but the app can reuse the buffer afterwards  For instance a game can render solid geometry in a first pass using color + depth buffers, then render shadows in another depth buffer, then draw shadows on top of the color buffer filled in the first pass. The game reuses the color buffer data and we can't clear it (otherwise we will lost every geometry data rendered). Same case for depth : games often render solid geometry and transparent geometry in two pass. If we clear depth buffer between the 2 pass (because of some postprocessing step for instance) the transparent object will be drawn on top of solid geometry. |2016-07-21 00:02:36|vlj

What level of opengl support is provided by HD 4600?  @vlj, Well, only Dx12 is affected by that specific issue since for some reason. Either dx12 is reusing old texture resources or the dx12 clear depth value during texture init is ignored, but I'll have to check. On vulkan and gl clearing new depth buffers to max depth fixes the issue. |2016-07-21 07:41:51|kd-11

All this change does is call glClearTexSubImage after a new surface is created. I have no performance difference on AMD GCN. I honestly think you are hitting the software fallback path, or the intel driver uses the same software method for texture clearing which is very bad. I'll modify to use opengl 3 clearbuffer although the code may get a little messier than it should |2016-07-21 07:59:41|kd-11

(between menu and ingame, in ingame sometimes i can even reach 30 (max) fps), and i think you should leave the current implementation if it works fine for every other real gpu.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1957|2016-07-20 20:18:10|2016-07-21 23:31:58|Well, I stumbled across complaints from people about poor performance using ARB_clear_texture on other projects. Even PCSX2 seems to have hit a similar issue and reverted back to clearbuffer*v for fbo surfaces. Apparently the speed is dependent on the type of clear being done, and depth clears are not particularly good. |2016-07-21 11:21:42|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1916|2016-07-14 22:17:56|2016-07-17 15:56:36|@vlj Why the array must fit completely in L1 cache if only parts of it are actually accessed? I would think about few cache lines actually used. However I would even store an array of `be_t<u32>` to avoid cost of byteswap for bool conversions. Also indirect function calls (registered methods) may have significant overhead for each RSX instruction compared to current implementation when only u32 value is copied. But I'm not profiling it, it could be that the overall amount of RSX instruction is not that big to produce noticeable overhead... |2016-07-16 22:02:42|Nekotekina
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1916|2016-07-14 22:17:56|2016-07-17 15:56:36|Actually there is already an indirect function call : for every instruction parsed, the operand is stored and then instruction opcode is tested in a rsx_method_t [] array. What I like is to combine both storage and calls to these special opcode values inside a single function table. To be honest I'm not sure if this PR will improve performance or not. I think it won't make a difference, we may loose some perf when parsing command buffer because of indirect function call but we may gain some performance in backends code by having smaller data members to read and by sorting them by relevance. For instance there are around 20 boolean values accessed as u32 with current implementation, without array they can be grouped on a single dword. As you suggest it would require some profiling (which is likely impractical atm given that there are innefficiencies in other part of rsx emulation, like no buffer caching)  On the other hand with this PR parsing the rsx_state at debug time is much much easier since the real values are accessible to the debuger instead of encoded version. And it's easier to dump rsx_state on disk if needed. |2016-07-16 22:39:25|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1916|2016-07-14 22:17:56|2016-07-17 15:56:36|@vlj I still think it's a mistake to use slow and obscure design just to make some values show in the debugger. If you need to peek them, the right approach would be to customize debug output, something like this: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj620914.aspx  To simplify access to individual values, there is another trick:  ``` C++ struct rsx_state { private:     std::array<u32, 0x10000 / 4> registers;  public:     u16& testreg1 = reinterpret_cast<u16&>(registers[NV4097_SET_VIEWPORT_HORIZONTAL]); ```  Now some value can be accessed transparently. It's not also the only way to implement it. For bit fields, there is `Utilities/BitField.h` custom bitfield class which can work even with big-endian values directly. It is also more correct to avoid using C/C++ "native" bitfields completely because they have unspecified layout. For debugging, as I said, there should be a way to customize debug output: for BEType, for BitField and anything else. |2016-07-19 13:53:04|Nekotekina
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1916|2016-07-14 22:17:56|2016-07-17 15:56:36|I'm switching to Bitfields atm. The issue I want to solve too is to enforce that whenever and opcode is used in code a dump() function is provided otherwise compilation break.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1916|2016-07-14 22:17:56|2016-07-17 15:56:36|Unfortunatly command buffer can change states several time before emitting an actual draw command. I guess it's because of some gfx API layer but it's not uncommon to have "vertex array X : (disabled)" then "vertex array X : type = ... size = ..." or depth write disabled and then reenabled. From rsx point of view only the last command that modifies a given parameter matters (it's a state machine afterall) so it might be hard to find a way that doesn't involve copying parameters to some location.  However I think copying parameters can be improved to some extend : currently every parameters are copied in a 16k array of u32. This array doesn't fit in L1 cache and I suspect it's not uncommon to access distant addresses : When looking at GCM.h it appears that every command block (ie NV4097, NV3062,...) is identified by a value in the high bits ("0x6XXX" for NV3062, "0x8XXX" for NV309E, "0xCXXX" for NV3089...) while some command block don't have a lot of command so a lot of space is unused. Since NV4097 is the 3d engine (and thus the mostly used block) and NV3089 is used to update fragment constant (and thus likely the second one most used block) I guess cache miss are rather frequent.  Another inefficiency is that some parameters are copied twice, for instance transform constant (a first time from command buffer to rsx::method_registers, and a second time to the actual transform constant buffer) or transform program (same : a first time from command buffer to rsx::method_registers and then from method_registers to the transform program buffer). |2016-07-14 23:27:15|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1907|2016-07-13 23:01:22|2016-07-14 18:25:38|Actually fragment program constants can be changed by memory write. Fragment constants are inlined in the fragment microcode which is stored in memory, while vertex shader and vertex shader constants are stored in registers. This means that an application can overwrite a fragment constant if it knows where it is stored.   Shader cache needs to check that a fragment shader instruction is not a constant otherwise it will always fail to recognize shader's footprint when a constant change (and it happens quite frequently).  Obviously from PS3 app developpers writing directly to shader microcode is likely not recommended since it requires some synchronisation (to avoid overwriting a constant when a shader is in use by RSX) so they often use a trick, they use the 2d command "NV308A_COLOR" which is used to draw a point in a framebuffer. When setting framebuffer format to float32 and point size to 1 pixel it will write exactly one float in memory at location determined by framebuffer start address, row and column.  This way adding a NV308A_COLOR command can be used to "draw a float pixel" at the fragment constant memory location before the fragment shader is actually used. It makes fragment constant update part of RSX command buffer which prevents concurrent memory access between RSX and Cell.  In RPCS3 the NV308A_COLOR operation is supported in rsx_methods.cpp (see nv308a::color<>::impl) |2016-07-14 00:04:15|vlj

I just don't understand why the fragment shader constants (all of them by the way) get trashed after a short while on opengl and the new decompiler.

Are there any plans what the per game config should contain?  I guess this would be very useful: - PPU Decoder - SPU Decoder - Load Libraries - Graphics (Renderer, etc.) - Audio  Should this also be part of the per game config? - Hook static functions - Load liblv2.sprx only  How should the pre game config be saved? The one that makes most sense to me is ` CONFIGDIR/game/GAMEID.yml` |2016-07-05 04:46:12|magiruuvelvet

So some super robust warning/checking is unnecessary (I think even current check is a little bit to much, but it's fine).  I agree with this so I removed the GCC 6.1 check afterwards, because this emulator is not interesting for most end-users right now, and every experienced user knows whats going on when the compiler itself dies with a segmentation fault, so this check is more or less unnecessary right know. Maybe we can add this in the future when the emulator can run a decent amount of commercial games. |2016-07-01 14:50:47|magiruuvelvet

It's just worth letting users (or devs, basically anyone trying to compile for any reason) ahead of time that it will/won't work with their compiler.

However GL is a state machine; the previously set depth func remains unless depth testing is enabled and not set to nothing as your fix does. Unless there is a driver bug, depth func should have no effect if depth test is disabled.  EDIT: If this is a driver bug, it should be reported to NV/AMD |2016-07-01 06:58:28|kd-11

This should not be necessary since depth testing is already disabled. The depth func should not matter if no depth test is enabled and the fact that that is not the case is rather odd. Of course the only way to confirm the correct behaviour is to check it against the reference rasterizer. |2016-07-02 09:18:50|kd-11

It's just for bulk decrypting a lot of modules at once. It loads every encrypted module one by one into the emulator which decrypts in afterwards, until the all modules are decrypted.  If you look at the code its basically just `MainFrame::BootElf` with a range-based for loop, nothing else.  Saves a lot of time when someone needs to decrypt LLE modules.  ##   First I wanted to extract the decryption code from RPCS3 and write a standalone CLI app for this, but I don't understand the dependency tree (header files) and failed. So I just added this to RPCS3 itself inside the GUI. |2016-06-30 03:18:52|magiruuvelvet

Meaning on the newcomer's guide http://www.emunewz.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=174352 it says   > How to decrypt the LLE modules? > For decrypting them, you need to rename the module to modulename.sprx.elf, and then use the "Boot ELF / SELF file" option on RPCS3 under "Boot". > The emulator will fail to run it, but you'll have decrypted the module. > Then, rename the file back to modulename.sprx and place it into the modules folder \dev_flash\sys\external in RPCS3.  Those renames i had to do manually. It would be nice and faster just to decode the .elf and do those renames automatically.  I would prefer the approach of having the list of modules predefined and then detect those present and decrypt them. all from the configure screen.

However your work does save a lot of time @GhettoGirl .  The file dialog has a restriction to select only `*.sprx` files. As I tried it and opened a bunch of modules the emulator outputed the decrypted modules alongside the input path with the `.prx` extension. So no file renaming with `elf` or something. It was pretty much straightforward and easy.  ---  @Nekotekina  > Can't say anything against it but proper solution would be decrypting them on the fly without creating any intermediate files (which is possible but not necessary).  I agree, that would be even better to directly load the encrypted modules and cache the decrypted into memory or something. Or do you mean, placing the encrypted modules into the `dev_flash` folder and have them alongside with the decrypted modules in the same directory as the emulator decrypts them on-the-fly? |2016-06-30 12:40:20|magiruuvelvet

So I can remove `Emu.Stop()` and `Emu.Load()`? Does the `SetPath` function already decrypts the module?

It is a hack that only works sometimes (luckily) and it's actually possible that there's some missing graphics somewhere that you just don't notice. Please don't put this in master. If I remember correctly, such outrageous hacks aren't supposed to be included in master. TL;DR Its actually luck that it works in this case. I wont go into explaining the blend equations but taking one look and you'll see that this is not a fix at all (it's a hack for this one game alone, at best) |2016-06-27 12:46:29|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1834|2016-06-27 03:57:09|2016-06-27 12:40:54|Yes , it is a hack and that's why i especially mentioned in the comment that it is wrong but as a workaround for this being only .  I left this commit for while and think it should be okay and no objection :( Anyway , i ok to revert it that respect the concern made here . |2016-06-27 13:24:58|raven02
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1834|2016-06-27 03:57:09|2016-06-27 12:40:54|Honestly, you should add an error in the log, since there will be games with messed up graphics. Also, the choice of "approximations" there is odd; I'd rather have it approximated as 1 for the constant_x and zero for one_minus_constant_x along with the error about it being a stub. |2016-06-27 13:32:48|kd-11

Another alternative would be to swap the two but that would make the blend src invisible. Or you can also just leave it as is (it will work for games that request color key blending but have an alpha component output that isn't garbage and fail for other cases) |2016-06-27 13:47:58|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1834|2016-06-27 03:57:09|2016-06-27 12:40:54|Yes, it looks okay with this approach .Will ask some error logging  as well |2016-06-27 16:15:57|raven02
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1834|2016-06-27 03:57:09|2016-06-27 12:40:54|Well, that's expected since most render targets dont use alpha (no alpha transparency on target is always DEST_ALPHA = 1 and INV_DEST_ALPHA = 0), which makes me think the author of the initial fix was just guessing and got lucky. |2016-06-27 21:03:33|kd-11

I'm aware of GL G8B8 as I was planning to push a fix for it (see https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/1753) but I haven't tested the rest. The 16-wide RGBA can be confirmed using terraria though, but I don't currently have the time to properly check this :( If the tests pass then you would be in the clear.  P.S The OpenGL and vulkan swizzles are _very_ tricky; the swizzle is dependent on both the input byte format and the provided sample format; e.g if you propose the upload texture format as BGRA  in texSubImage2D the swizzle would be different from RGBA format.

There is always scaling in place when we copy the final image to the screen and scaling always happens unless the game's internal resolution matches the window size. This means that for every game, there is a "perfect" window size where everything will be ok, but resizing will trigger the scaling. Try running commercial games at 720x480 and see what happens. |2016-06-16 16:40:36|kd-11

Ingame allocation when other stuff is also allocated goes slighttly over 1G causing paging in and out and reported slowdowns on DX12. It should help alleviate some games slowing to a crawl since most games dont actually use that much vram anyway. Either way, I think the proper allocation strategy should also consider that DWM uses some of that same VRAM so (VRAM-128) is still going to hammer resources.  My proposal is to keep something like MIN(VRAM-128-X, Y) where X is an allowance we can leave for dwm and Y is the limit we choose. I dont think that 1G is actually needed. I've honestly never seen allocation in vulkan go over 400M. |2016-06-15 16:53:30|kd-11

And some unreasonable value for users with >1GB of ram. Seems rather strange for such small number of people. Also, iGPU shouldn't have problems with big heap. Furthermore, in many games, not demanding graphically, my performance with intel iGPU was slightly better than with r9 since all VRAM was stored in RAM and there is no shuffling around.  Can't we make this option configurable though? |2016-06-15 17:02:57|danilaml

This would not be a final solution either way but i need to go through the Dx12 backend to track resource usage and see about being smart with the vram allocation. |2016-06-15 17:09:08|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1786|2016-06-15 15:52:41|2016-06-19 03:01:12|@raven02 Can you test if the new changes harm any games negatively? Try more graphically intensive games and see if we exceed that ~384M allocated to buffers. @danilaml 512M should be okay since the other 128 is still used by the games On current openGL I use ~33M for buffers and they work just fine. |2016-06-15 17:13:50|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1786|2016-06-15 15:52:41|2016-06-19 03:01:12|I think it should be okay as we have cap here .For example, if you have 2G dedicate video memory (AMD or NV) or have 3G shared system memory allocated (iGPU) , it will only allocate 768M max which is same as before  |2016-06-15 17:13:56|raven02

Ask @vlj if he has time.  Try with fw_dice_test for example. I think Neo Burn Climax hit the threshold too, but not sure. |2016-06-15 17:16:07|danilaml

Also note that some drivers can interfere with warp loading correctly since some drivers install themselves as proxies and then redirect calls to the proper drivers (i've seen this with nvidia drivers and optimus) |2016-06-16 14:28:19|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1783|2016-06-15 03:19:44|2016-06-18 17:27:29|The GL spec is very vague about what states affect the outcome of glblitframebuffer. It is clear that scissor test, pixel ownership tests and srgb are honoured but nothing is mentioned on write masks. As such, please also disable color masking just in case by setting all channels to GL_TRUE. BLEND, LOGIC_OP and CULL_FACE need not be toggled in my opinion as they are per-fragment and per-primitive operations and the fragment processing stage is skipped during a hardware blit. Depth testing and stencil test may not be needed, but a buggy driver may result in undefined results so its okay to disable them. |2016-06-15 09:04:20|kd-11

Even then, you should have a ~5-10 fps gain although i don't own d3. Maybe your cpu is powerful enough to offset the gains anyway.  I've tested with Hitman, Afterburner climax, Prince of Persia, Outrun online, and TNT racers.

That merge commit is likely going to cause trouble for actually cleanly rebasing (from my experience) - ie. you might want to simply redo the commit (_git reset --hard_, reapply your changes and _git push -f_).

We've been also getting rid of wxWidgets dependencies in emucore (and it was just finished). This seems to quite against it. Seems like I misunderstood the changes. I still see no reason to downgrade to an older, more hacky and vulnerable libpng version. If you distro or whatever doesn't have a more recent version, then you should install, download or compile a newer one for your system.~~ Well, I guess It's ok to support older versions. |2016-05-03 16:00:09|tambry

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1661|2016-04-05 21:52:21|2016-04-06 20:03:14|@Nekotekina glShadeModel is not needed with core, GL_CLAMP is replaced with CLAMP_TO_EDGE and CLAMP_TO_BORDER, I chose to use CLAMP_TO_EDGE. Enabling blend for MRTs is rewritten to use the buffer indices rather than the COLOR_ATTACHMENTn values, after observing debug output from drivers (AMD driver actually replaces it with a call to glEnableIndexed). |2016-04-06 08:24:22|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1661|2016-04-05 21:52:21|2016-04-06 20:03:14|@Nekotekina glShadeModel was deprecated in favor of shader interpolation qualifiers. GL_CLAMP was removed from core and has no true replacement for it. I went with CLAMP_TO_EDGE to avoid any unwanted seams from border color sampling since this would never have happened using the old GL_CLAMP. |2016-04-06 11:03:17|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1661|2016-04-05 21:52:21|2016-04-06 20:03:14|@Nekotekina GL backend was migrated to a core profile recently by vlj. Also, CLAMP_TO_EDGE should give similar results to GL_CLAMP in almost all cases. We could just add them back, but debug layers spam the logs with deprecated feature errors. Also, IHVs dont have to support legacy GL with compatibility profile unless they want to (but it is supported widely on Windows at least). |2016-04-06 11:27:04|kd-11

In that respect, since it  is only used by trophy files, I think you have to receive a trophy, access a trophy or trophy list, etc.  If by working working correctly you mean does it compile, only time and the build bots will tell.

ARGB8 is uploaded untouched to avoid the cost of swizzling but in your code ARGB4 is byte swapped (it's read as be_t<u16> and written as u16).

I'll probably be adding texture generation for the 4 missing DEPTH texture formats, so I can confirm if it's correct on RPCS3. I'll be pushing the final version of the fixed up texture formats test to my [PS3Tests](https://github.com/tambry/PS3Tests) sometime tonight. (RSX/TextureFormats, TEST00008)  Also do you have any ideas why 2nd rows 2nd texture is messed up? It should be CELL_GCM_TEXTURE_R5G5B5A1. |2016-04-07 04:45:09|tambry

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1649|2016-03-31 18:40:57|2016-03-31 21:49:55|It's not targeted at a specific game.   Basically the function returns the true mipmap count of the texture.  RSX can accept a mipmap level of 12 for a 128x128 texture ; however you can reduce such texture only 8 times (128=2^7). In case of compressed texture the base level is a 4x4 texture ie it can be reduced only 6 times Opengl and Vulkan texture is invalid if texture mipmap count is too high. This function is clamping texture mipmap count reported by rsx with the max possible mipmap count allowed by the texture width height and format.  |2016-03-31 19:08:46|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1601|2016-03-19 03:44:25|2016-03-20 16:08:13|Why did you open multiple PRs for the same issue? You can simply force push and use other git commands. If you don't know about these possibilities, then it might be a good idea to look at _git reset_, _git rebase_ and _git push (-f)_ documentation. |2016-03-19 05:22:00|tambry

So adding it there won't help, as wxWidgets on AppVeyor is located in a completely different place, but all of it's includes are found by CMake. wxWidgets on there doesn't have 3rd party headers though (including zlib). And for that reason we use [pre-built zlib](https://402331b94f8e4b87ae2ef4677347f7956cf3861f.googledrive.com/host/0B6v_qtb9hkicfmt0NG0wTTRtUmF4X3VTQk5Oc2JidEVKVnUteDA1dXdrYlNsVW9kREpsSHc/zlib.7z).

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1601|2016-03-19 03:44:25|2016-03-20 16:08:13|@tambry Sorry about that. I ran into a bug that I tried to fix by making several commits. When I tried git rebase, it squashed the commits on my local machine, but they all still appeared in the PR. So Travis and Appveyor would have been trying to build each of those ~15 commits, and I didn't want my screwups monopolizing their build queue.  I'm not trying to excuse what I did, I know it was not the best course of action. I now know that I don't need to make any commits to fix the bug I was having, so it won't happen again. And yes, I will absolutely spend more time looking at the documentation. Its not my first time using git, but I could use a refresher.  Again, sorry about the mess, and thanks for the advice. |2016-03-19 13:53:28|mpm11011

I'm still thinking about the best way to do with Vulkan.

The fragment constant buffer is a dynamic uniform buffer since Nvidia recommended it and MS docs moreless say it's ok to have a couple dynamic descriptors for fragment shader resources since some hardware prefers it.  Moving to finer descriptor layout didn't bring big performance increase since vertex buffer and fragment constants have to change every draw call and I'm still copying texture descriptors to present them as a single array. On the long term however having a split descriptor layouts allows to pass some descriptors (like textures one) as an array of descriptor and thus almost completly removing resource binding from the cpu side. Unfortunatly this is only possible on DX12 Tier 2+ resource binding hardware (ie only GCN 1.1+ Maxwell and skylake). |2016-03-17 19:36:19|vlj

I separated the descriptor sets to 2 to make the code and generated shaders easier to undestand.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1585|2016-03-16 19:48:13|2016-03-17 13:39:55|You stumbled upon an interesting bug there. You're right it does seem hackish. What happens if you run the emulator with DX12 selected on win7? Maybe you could set the current renderer value to enum_value_of(checkbox.text) instead of just using the checkbox.selected_index value. Just trace where the configuration loader translates strings in config files to renderer enums and use that. I cant remember which file it's in, but i know it exists since I had to add vulkan there. That would be a more permanent solution. |2016-03-16 21:09:54|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1548|2016-03-06 19:19:08|2016-03-10 23:08:32|@vlj It shouldn't be mandatory since it means those textures require copying to a staging texture then doing a copyimage call. obviously this isn't ideal. I try to check if linear tiling is supported for a texture format before uploading. The staging texture must have linear tiling enabled so that one can upload texture data manually using the textureutils functions. I'm honestly not sure how to fix that one right now. I'm guessing this happens during staging texture creation, right? |2016-03-07 21:02:07|kd-11
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1548|2016-03-06 19:19:08|2016-03-10 23:08:32|Yes it happens at texture creation. BTW if I use RenderDoc injection in RPCS3 I'm getting a lot more validation error : https://gist.github.com/vlj/7480ca22a443be5af79c |2016-03-07 21:07:07|vlj

It might just be depth and color attachments or something. I check for tiling support but only for sampled images since they require data to be uploaded. Also, with renderdoc, i'm assuming that renderdoc is the one injecting those extra descriptors, since the errors are absent without renderdoc even with the same validation layers on. I see the same with official lunarG samples and renderdoc. |2016-03-07 21:10:35|kd-11

Now there is an exception throw in  "       vram_allocation.allocate_from_pool(device, m_memory_layout.size, m_memory_layout.memoryTypeBits);" call : "Could not find suitable memory type!"  I think it's because a render target is visible only by the gpu so it shouldn't allocate from a VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT pool.  BTW it's interesting to note that if it works it means that AMD gpu can draw in host visible memory which may lead to some nice optimisation in the long term. |2016-03-07 21:46:34|vlj

Two errors reported by the debug layers :  "·E {rsx::thread} RSX: ERROR: [MEM] Code 16 : vkCmdBeginRenderPass(): Cannot read invalid memory e6a0b60, please fill the memory before using." Digging into this error inside the debug layer reveals that depth stencil VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD in renderpass is the culprit. I think it's because the first time the depth stencil image is created it has undefined content. I'm not sure if it's an issue at driver level or if it's more a warning about API apparent misusage. Using VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE fix the issue. I think a proper fix would involve issuing a clear command to a rtt surface right after it has been created.  The second error is  "vkQueuePresentKHR(): Cannot read invalid swapchain image e3f01a0, please fill the memory before using." This one seems to crash Nvidia driver. Investigating memlayer code didn't bring me a lot of information, I suspect here that the swapchain content is considered undefined as well before being presented but flip() should fill it with the content of surface target A or B. |2016-03-09 00:55:12|vlj

Try https://github.com/kd-11/rpcs3/tree/vulkan-nvidia-tests and see if it flips.

Performance is generally in the same region, but some games are a bit faster with vulkan, and some that are broken on GL work on vulkan even though the codebase is the same. There are advantages since the driver isn't doing checks and guesses to figure out what the emu is trying to do.   |2016-03-07 08:11:55|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1530|2016-03-02 09:43:41|2016-03-05 10:51:25|Just wonder what is frame-by-frame read/write buffers ? and how to determine it  |2016-03-02 09:44:52|raven02
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1530|2016-03-02 09:43:41|2016-03-05 10:51:25|@raven02 I mean that the current implementation that i'm using tries to avoid download by storing the data on the gpu unless needed, but for now, it never actually downloads the data, only uploads. If the cell uploads (writes) data, the cache will be invalidated (rightfully), but if the cell reads from an old cache in system ram, it will obtain invalid data, possibly corrupting the next write. To make it work properly, I'd need to download gpu buffers when accessed, probably by marking the regions as not-present instead of read-only and downloading when actually accessed. I need a test-case to check correct behaviour though. |2016-03-02 09:51:00|kd-11

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1521|2016-02-26 14:28:14|2016-04-16 08:10:34|I would agree that submitting smaller commits is better than this, but since I began to do several things simultaneously, splitting them would require a lot of additional work and rewriting some lines of code multiple times. Plus additional effort to ensure that intermediate commits are compilable by themselves, otherwise it won't help one bisect.

Btw, don't how configuration system is implemented right now but it should be opt-in (i.e. use global settings unless specific settings are given, probably with possibility to use ini dbs to set best settings for some games (like in other emulators)). |2016-03-06 20:30:34|danilaml

For PPU recompiler some code is rewritten [there](https://github.com/RPCS3/llvm-compiler).  `gsl::narrow` lacks custom message so it may be inconvenient. Not sure that it needs formatting though (I implemented two overloads). |2016-03-06 20:49:22|Nekotekina

I think that's a good change, since cellResc implementation seems quite confusing and not very good on master. Might be better to strip it out completely for now, so someone can rewrite it.   There was some refactoring for cellAudio, so there might be a bug caused by refactoring, if the SG no longer works without cellAudio. |2016-03-10 17:47:54|tambry

Most files from different versions are bitwise identical, for example (not all, of course). Module names usually resemble filenames and "v1.1" thing isn't very useful too in my opinion. And they conflict for some files. On the other side, filenames cannot conflict, and they are important themselves (because original liblv2/libsysmodule/??? loader uses exactly filenames for module loading). |2016-03-14 10:46:19|Nekotekina

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1496|2016-02-11 11:53:42|2016-02-15 09:03:48|Nice catch.   I think gcm.cpp code correctly parses control 2 and 3, I had an issue where some texture related opcode had a stride of 8 and some other a stride of 1.  Dx12 doesn't use texture pitch from the register and computes it from texture width. It'd likely not accurate but I didn't know how to interpret the pitch value from the register when I wrote the code: sometimes it's 0 and sometimes the pitch value is wrong. Actually the pitch value is ignored if texture is swizzled. Textures and their mipmaps level are tightly packed. If texture is linear stored then pitch is used for textures and mipmap levels. Since mipmap width is halved at every level it takes more storage space with unused memory gap (which is sometimes used to store other texture like in after burner climax)  Depth is almost always 1. As far as I know rsx doesn't support texture array so depth is needed only in 3d texture case which are rare. The only game that uses a 3d texture so far is Resogun in the first level.  That's likely why it wasn't spotted before.  |2016-02-11 17:20:27|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1491|2016-02-09 10:07:46|2016-02-13 15:51:56|It should be gl_FragCoord indeed. I assumed gl_Position worked when I saw it in the fragment decompiler class since I had no way to test (I think first game I tested that use it is After Burner Climax which doesn't work with gl).  I don't know if the z and w value are the same as gl_FragCoords ones. The behavior can be customised with the NV4097_SET_SHADER_WINDOW behavior : https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/commit/f6d2409b2082ead31366b61c5974dcdff49e4ca5  The "origin mode" setting change the origin of the coordinate system : pixel (0, 0) or (.5, .5) can be either the upper left hand corner of the screen ("openGL style") or the lower left hand corner ("D3D style"). Since RSX is a G70 derivative that supports both API on PC nvidia likely left the register for PS3 dev usage. The "pixel center" setting can be used to add a (.5, .5) bias to the pixel coordinate. By default gl_FragCoord stores pixel coordinate as integer value (ie (0, 0)   (0,1) ...(0,1279); (1,0) (11) ...). However from a sampler point of view, texel are located at half one offset. ie the first texel of a texture is "spread" (in unormalized coordinates) between [0, 1] on x axis, the second in [1 2], ... [1279, 1280]. If bilinear filter is used then the exact texel value can be accessed right at the middle of the range, ie 0.5; 1.5; 2.5; ... 1279.5. Since render target textures are often accessed as texture it makes sense to add an half one offset to the pixel coordinates which can then maps 1:1 to render target texel. |2016-02-11 01:44:55|vlj

The exception messages were too broad and only have brought reports about already known problems. Anything that would be thrown would simply be reported. This causes a lot of new users to simply report these "problems" and has caused quite a lot of spam on the forums over the past month.   This PR probably needs to be re-reviewed. |2016-02-18 18:41:01|tambry

If you really want to improve it, it'll require some different kind of work. For example, let's say there is ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION error code. We could handle this error specifically and tell the user that he is really mean trying to run rpcs3 on really OLD CPU which doesn't even support SSSE3. Or something. |2016-02-18 20:50:37|Nekotekina

Might be noteworthy, that with cellPngDec LLE, there are some internal errors in cellPngDec, which causes it to fail to decode certain pictures, thus the main menu is missing a lot of effects.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1467|2016-01-30 18:16:59|2016-02-07 17:09:47|Unfortunatly no, RSX sampling opcode are "typeless". They only encode the operation (sample, sample proj, sample + lod) but texture type is stored in hardware register. That's why RSXFragmentProgram has a "   u16 unnormalized_coords;" member that must be filled every draw call. But it's available to the FragmentDecompiler so you can query the i-th bit of unnormalized_coords member of the current decompiled fragment shader : if it is set then the texture is not normalised and the input needs to be divided by texture size in d3d12 (but it looks like GL has the textureRect sampler that just do this), if it's not set then texture coordinate are normalised. |2016-01-30 20:24:15|vlj

TextureUtils.cpp handle texture cube format and proper mipmap upload (GL relies on the driver mipmap algorithm and ignore mipmap level from app atm) |2016-01-18 17:46:44|vlj

Finding the actual correlation of the connection status and link status on a real PS3 would be very hard and tedious. It's best to assume, if the connection status is set as completely connected (IP obtained), then we can tell the game, that we're connected. |2016-01-07 06:50:25|tambry

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1394|2016-01-03 23:05:46|2016-01-08 01:09:05|You need to download from NuGet 2 tools, cppcorecheck and gsl (search with "static analysis" keyword).  Unfortunately they're not compatible with shared pch (as static analysis) but it's possible to manually disable pch and run the tools. They're still work in progress and they crash on d3d12gsrender analysis now. I don't know if we should enable the tools for travis. It will print several warnings in the log and they're likely a lot of them. We should fix all the errors emitted by clang before enabling them by default.  Meanwhile it can be run manually on part of project.   Please note that while GSL helps static tools, c++ type system already ensures some bounds and type checking happening at compile time and runtime with as least redundancy as possible. For instance the span template ensures that there is no buffer overflow happening when used naked pointers (which are common since we deal with memory).  |2016-01-04 19:31:26|vlj

I found that Minecraft [NPUB31419] uses l10n_get_converter and l10n_convert_str of the string conversion functions. This PR makes Minecraft crash. Though previously it would simply make it crash later on in some DX12 string handling, which could've been caused by the problems of the previous string conversion.  **Log:** https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tambry/1a12b5ab89082b181388/raw/4bc2a45c87a5e4b72918c86454e46c0d49388acf/Minecraft%2520%255BNPUB31419%255D |2015-12-24 21:14:22|tambry
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1362|2015-12-21 18:25:43|2016-01-01 23:26:25|It looks like Minecraft is passing NULL as the destination pointer; it may be that the function treats dst==NULL as "return only the length and discard the data". I'll go ahead and add that in, since I don't see any other reason the program would be passing a null pointer. |2015-12-24 23:39:18|achurch
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1362|2015-12-21 18:25:43|2016-01-01 23:26:25|FWIW, it does indeed look like Minecraft is using a "get length first" pattern in a previous call (which doesn't crash for whatever reason):  ``` HLE: W {PPU Thread[0x1] (main_thread)[0x0081e1b4]} cellL10n: l10n_convert_str(cd=65536, src=*0x20df0580, src_len=*0xd000f9e0, dst=*0x0, dst_len=*0xd000f9e4) HLE: W {PPU Thread[0x1] (main_thread)[0x0081e1b4]} cellL10n: l10n_convert_str(cd=65536, src=*0x20df0580, src_len=*0xd000f9e0, dst=*0x22ded150, dst_len=*0xd000f9e4) ```  Given that that previous call doesn't crash, it may be that the null pointer isn't the cause of the crash, but the call pattern does suggest to me that this special handling of a null destination pointer is correct. |2015-12-25 00:14:03|achurch

Most games that use those libraries currently are either very unstable, or don't work at all, and in most cases LLE of the module is required for the game to work. I would like to rewrite all of those libraries eventually to have a proper implementation and work like they're actually intended. If you want I could elaborate more on the reasons why they're so badly implemented, I can. 2) Didn't realize that, fixed. 3) Why have type aliases in the first place? I think they make the code less readable. I personally for example often use the "peek definition" in Visual Studio 2015 to see what the structure contains, and then use the information I can see in that little peek to write code further. 4) I don't remember ever removing newlines at the end of files objectively. Might have been due to a rebase. |2016-01-17 17:51:26|tambry

There are a possibly quite a few problems, as was already noted by Nekoteki.  The current goal is to respond review criticism and find out somehow to fix the Travis build (I could probably contact libpng guys for help) and the AppVeyor build.

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1359|2015-12-20 20:33:09|2016-02-12 13:08:10|@tambry Tip: split all changes unrelated to libpng and cellPngDec into another commit, move that commit in another branch, keep that branch in your repo, or even in RPCS3.  About aliases: they made function headers shorter via removing repeating elements, that's all. They are at least as readable as original definitions, or better. Only "Peek definition" usage doesn't look like a good excuse to remove them, because you need complete documentation in order to work with these structures anyway. VS features don't seem broken in any way while working with aliases. |2016-01-18 15:37:29|Nekotekina

So the "0x" placed before is useless, it all points. My example shows good, its is pointless to have "0x4" only "4" interests us. So yes, clearly, the "0x" before is completely unnecessary. But let's say that I understand nothing, it just seems logical that's all great. And if I shit in the code, it means that the code is therefore already the problem, since I have seen several times when there was not just the "0x" and that's just fine, example in cellAdec etc. |2015-12-20 15:07:51|Zangetsu38

Sorry but before "10" now "0x10" it is a change nothing   I want to say is that the "0x" always appears before I tested, so it does not help, if "5" it shows "0x5", yet it is just "5 ", and when it is" 16 "so it reads" 0x10 "except that before that already showed" 10 ", so sorry but it didnt changed absolutely nothing.

This means that you wont be able to fork, send pull requests, open issues and comment on both issues and pull requests. The ban should come into effect in less than a couple hours. This decision was made after careful consideration by the core developers of RPCS3. We found your code contribution and comments often useless, disruptive or a waste of developers' time. We also found your language comprehension bad, making it hard for us to communicate with you. Please remember, that this decision was ~~not~~ made lightly. We hope you understand the decision, and will be able to use the extra time for actually learning programming and the basic concepts of it. We also hope you'll continue to test different games, provide feedback and post interesting results for developers on the forum.  Season's greetings, RPCS3 team |2015-12-20 15:49:45|tambry

We have already previously warned/told you to politely to stop wasting developers' time. While you might not be good at programming or making code contributions, I still think that you make useful contributions in the form of game testing and reporting issues with different games. I hope you will continue to make contributions in the future in by testing games and reporting the issues on forum or IRC.  **EDIT:** You could though always improve your testing procedure, by recording videos using the English language in games, so the general public could understand. You should also **always** mention, if any hacks or a non-master branch was used for testing. |2015-12-20 17:05:41|tambry

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1341|2015-12-12 15:01:56|2015-12-13 23:34:59|I initially implemented stencil ops without knowing what the difference was between _WRAP and non _WRAP opcodes and there was no test using the _WRAP variant. But it makes sense that "wrap" means 255+1 is 0 actually. Which is the default (ie non SAT) version in d3d12.  So Bigpet is actually right, the correct mapping is : CELL_GCM_INCR = D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR_SAT CELL_GCM_DECR = D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR_SAT CELL_GCM_INCR_WRAP = D3D12_STENCIL_OP_INCR CELL_GCM_DECR_WRAP = D3D12_STENCIL_OP_DECR  Still I'd like to have comment mentionning the game where the opcode can be found for testing purpose. A big portion of function in D3D12Formats.h are not properly tested because no app use them (for instance logic op ones). Documenting which app uses a function allows me to know what to test when I'm doing a change (there is no really better way to test gfx code atm). |2015-12-12 20:35:41|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1332|2015-12-05 21:26:58|2015-12-07 07:44:19|@vlj what was the purpose of moving all these function to map (like `vm.reservation_update`)? They are not "executables" and have different interface than others. They might as well remain separate entity. Because of them map of executables changed to map of void ptrs and conversion from/to `void*` of function ptrs is not well defined afaik (it's either prohibited or implementation defined, but I might be wrong on this). **UPD:** Yeah, it seems to be prohibited in one direction and possibly implementation detail in the other: http://stackoverflow.com/a/25816309/4114447 |2015-12-06 00:01:51|danilaml
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1332|2015-12-05 21:26:58|2015-12-07 07:44:19|@danilaml the Call Template was already putting the function to executable_map (which was called executableMap before) : "               m_executableMap[name] = (Executable)(void *&)function;" When building a module we don't use the function address at all. LLVM's ExecutionEngine is responsible for symbol resolution on the other hand, that's why we were recording the name to Executable mapping. With this PR I record all the "system" name to Executable function before creating the module. executable_map can be updated by compiler to record "dynamic" (ie other function to-be compiled) symbols.  Like you mention casting pointer to member is prohibited and that's how I discovered that there was issues with PPUThread::fast_stop. A pointer to member is not a function and ABI is not compatible. Likely we weren't emitting the PPUThread::fast_stop or we didn't execute the call otherwise it would trigger a crash since the pointer is invalid (and we didn't provide the pointer to this anyways) |2015-12-06 00:21:25|vlj
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1332|2015-12-05 21:26:58|2015-12-07 07:44:19|The function interface doesn't matter btw as long as they are functions. In x86 a function is just an instruction address (pretty much like in PPC), the function call site is responsible for saving register content, pushing the arguments, calling the function, and restoring register after the function returns.  That's different for pointer to member because function can be virtual, a "call" needs to fetch the type of the object and fetch the actual function pointer. |2015-12-06 00:29:28|vlj

"cannot convert from void(__cdecl PPUThread::_)(void) to void_" Which is conformant with the link you gave.  I have no idea why it built before. We let the template type deduction do the magic and it likely took a type (std::function ?) that could be casted properly to void*. |2015-12-06 01:14:23|vlj

It hangs for me trying to get to character creation (i think from savedata), but main menu colors are correct.

What change to win8.1 as a target platform brings?

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1291|2015-11-10 22:42:54|2015-11-25 00:24:52|Why harmful sometimes ?  noexcept is an hint telling the compiler that the function won't throw, and thus it can optimise away the seh branching logic in windows build. Plus containers like std::vector use a faster implementation if the underlying object has a non throwing move operator.  Of course it's harmful if a noexcept function is actually throwing but it should be fixed in the specific function, not ban noexcept for every other ones. |2015-11-15 19:19:10|vlj
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1291|2015-11-10 22:42:54|2015-11-25 00:24:52|What SEH branching logic? Anyway, you can't sacrifice correctness for some imaginary optimizations.

And besides, SEH exceptions should be zero cost if they doesn't happen, same with noexcept and terminate.

I'm not really surprised to hear intel hd is performing better though, since the dice test is uploading a lot of vertex data per frame. I currently use a ram located buffer to store all the vertex data (since they are reuploaded each time) so dgpu has to pay the pcie overhead each time it has to access non cached vertex data whereas igpu can directly read the data in ram.  I think I will add a copy operation to amortize the cost for dgpu though. On the other hand dice is a very specific test (only a couple of textures, lot of draw calls) so I don't think it will matter as much on real game (where there are more texture, and dgpu can access them faster). |2015-11-06 19:15:19|vlj

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1276|2015-10-29 00:25:36|2015-10-30 20:12:52|rpcs3 doesn't define NDEBUG even in release mode, so unreachable just calls abort and can provide line number and file name when it crashes. If we ever define NDEBUG yes the compiler will assume that this code is not reachable and thus will optimise the switch (possibly turning it into a non switch statement) but it's rather for performance build rather than debug one and I don't think we will provide a performance build soon. It suppresses the "control reaches non void" warning emitted by several compilers.  It's used everywhere in llvm (that's where I took the code snippet) as "abort" and "assert(0)" is considered there as not bringing enough information and occuring an unecessarry if statement in code for performance build. |2015-10-30 16:15:15|vlj

But you can use the pragmas for now, I mean I am not quite sure how the converstation about dropping the manually made *.sln completely in favor of a CMake generated one ended. I guess it was "wait until the cmake one works for 100% of the build variants" |2015-10-22 19:14:09|Bigpet

Currently RSXThreads copies vertex data to a vector, and the backend copies the vertex data from RSXThreads to the gfx API. It would be better to have RSXThreads copy directly to the gfx API. With GL it could be implemented using glBufferData(..., size, nullptr, GL_STATIC_DRAW); return glMapBuffer(...); |2015-10-07 21:42:02|vlj

At advancing rpcs3, these three 0 really have no sense, v0.0.0.5 rpcs3 the beginning, and that of this have nothing to see.  Whether the LLVM, DX12, "interpreter 2" and all the rest, there's even already has several games that turns perfectly trading 60 fps, and the other works but gently (Disgaea 3) then why would a this kept many 0 when the emulator is already so advanced.  The 0.0.0.6 is good, but it was eight months ago that he had put the it's just too late, the project out of position since, if one calculates a can, the emulator should 0.0.1 may be near the old tag were never as long term, the 5 remained more than a year, it's huge, + 2500 commit ...

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1236|2015-09-30 11:25:41|2015-10-02 13:46:41|I think the middle part in "v0.0.0.5-2533-gf677782" (the 2533 in this case) is really useful. It's the number of commits since the last version tag.  Just by having "v0.0.0.5 gf677782" and "v0.0.0.5 g4ac6c23" you couldn't tell which one is newer, but with "v0.0.0.5-2533-gf677782" and "v0.0.0.5-2531-g4ac6c23" you can see which one has more commits (doesn't always indicate that it's newer, but it's a reasonably good approximation).  ~~edit: also the description `Select "use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" on Adjusting your PATH environement Screen"` is not something that is clear and there's no "use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" to "select" for the normal Git client, that's some Github GUI specific thing.~~  edit2: nvm on that first edit, that's an install option, I thought you meant to start it.

Since cellSail callbacks are required to pass a struct that contains the info about why the callback was called, etc. Passing a pointer or reference doesn't work. |2015-08-12 05:54:29|tambry
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1172|2015-08-05 15:44:46|2015-08-24 19:54:17|C++ doesn't support reflection so you can't do much about such structs passed by value. Fortunately, it's rare. The only option is to decompose them manually according to their fields' displacement in GPRs, FPRs, VPRs registers and the stack. Here is a partial solution to cover CellSailEvent specific case:  ``` C++ union CellSailEvent {     be_t<u64> value;      struct _data_t     {         be_t<u32> major;         be_t<u32> minor;     }; };  template<typename T, bool is_enum> struct cast_ppu_gpr;  template<> struct cast_ppu_gpr<CellSailEvent, false> {     force_inline static u64 to_gpr(const CellSailEvent& event)     {         return event.value;     } }; ``` |2015-08-12 14:40:58|Nekotekina

The `typename` disambiguator for dependent names In a declaration or a definition of a template, including alias template, a name that is not a member of the current instantiation and is dependent on a template parameter is not considered to be a type unless the keyword `typename` is used or unless it was already established as a type name, e.g. with a typedef declaration or by being used to name a base class.  |2015-05-18 19:52:51|Syphurith

Looked up the error in the Travis Build log, it seems X11 header broke our `Ultilities/Log.h`.  ``` In file included from /home/travis/build/RPCS3/rpcs3/rpcs3/Emu/RSX/GSManager.cpp:8: In file included from /home/travis/build/RPCS3/rpcs3/rpcs3/Emu/RSX/GL/GLGSRender.h:8: In file included from /home/travis/build/RPCS3/rpcs3/rpcs3/Emu/RSX/GL/GLProgramBuffer.h:3: In file included from /home/travis/build/RPCS3/rpcs3/rpcs3/Emu/RSX/GL/../Common/ProgramStateCache.h:5: /home/travis/build/RPCS3/rpcs3/rpcs3/../Utilities/Log.h:55:3: error: expected identifier                 Success,                 ^ /usr/include/X11/X.h:350:21: note: expanded from macro 'Success' #define Success            0    /* everything's okay */                            ^ 1 error generated. ```  Which was designed to be an enum. The `Log.h` header itself doesn't include wrong files but it seems conflict with the X11 header. Should we need a `#ifdef` or `#undef` macro somewhere (ugly)? BTW the two `Success` has different value. You can still rename those symbols in Log.h to avoid this issue. |2015-05-19 16:21:49|Syphurith

If you would like to do it according to the versions of files, you could create a branch locally and merge them. Once built and run games succuessfully you can upload your branch.. That's it. The question `Why do you not merge` can always be asked oneself if he really care about that. raven is busy debugging those RSX renderer details, and most of the behaviors is revealed by RE.

Except the C++11 features, how do you feel about the VS2015? ~~VS2013 distributes many junk packages with it (i mean Azure, Ad SDK, WP SDK.. blabla with it). Well hope VS installation could be more customed than VS2013. Since it is a developer tool, not a end-user tool.~~ This pull looks good for me (except would have some time compile it again). Yep. ~~I'm getting envy about those citra-emu developing. Rpcs3 started before it.~~ |2015-05-09 04:16:14|Syphurith
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1079|2015-05-08 19:29:32|2015-05-09 12:44:06|@Syphurith the installation of VS2015 is still huge. I didn't really test much with VS2015 but I like that it's finally almost C99 compatible (although they did back-peddle on the standard wprintf/wsnprintf/etc. format specifiers which makes me kind of sad). But I did run across some C++ library regressions which I hope will get fixed in the final release (or at least in update 1 :smile: )  As for the development speed. Well, the codebase of rpcs3 is not quite as approachable as citras (to put it charitably). Most importantly there's no really experienced and active maintainer/developer steering the direction of rpcs3.  But there's still some active development (thanks in large part to Nekotekina ). So it could be worse. |2015-05-09 04:38:37|Bigpet
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1079|2015-05-08 19:29:32|2015-05-09 12:44:06|@Bigpet To me i have hard time in reading code and understand those. Just a C programmer. I don't know should we call for document some files to help us understand those better. Such as call relations, real reason about some calls.. also it would need someone to read some part of the code and that help himself understand the architecture. eh maybe would find some weird parts also. It seems the project has little active developers now. Some documents are hard to find. Even B1ackDaemon have his unit but we have not much tests to run. Maybe a proposal should be made.. |2015-05-09 05:05:36|Syphurith

Can not get to irc - all IPs are banned. There is [some links](https://gist.github.com/Syphurith/27341bb563fff5346380) i don't know if helps rpcs3 devs. Found nucleus doc i think we may write some documents about how code arranged.. and designed.  BTW **Lack of active developers may result in severe problems**. Maybe need to figure out some reasonable cause why developing rpcs3 is so hard, or not friendly. If i am getting annoying please forgive my behavior. I know i'm some kind of talk terminator.. |2015-05-09 06:32:37|Syphurith

PSVita Dev.wiki is almost blank, so no information could be collected. rpcs3 is a PS3 emulator. Only if you are really talented in emulator development, you can ask for its name and help. The next generation of rpcs3 must still be in development stage, not even a beta or alpha.. Or else wait. |2015-05-14 02:32:48|Syphurith

However still no Vita emulator present, cause no internal details about it. what Neko did in rpcs3 for Vita are only stubs. if not believed you can take a look at `<cloned rpcs3 repo path>rpcs3\Emu\ARMv7\`. I can't explain the way to implement an emulator cause i can just fix some minor problems, and i don't want to do so. If interested you could google for such, there are articles about emulator implementation.

I don't understand the `#ifdef __APPLE__` stuff but you put it there so you'd know better :smile: (and it seems related to #1072 )  (I'll assume the size increase in `fs_st_cb_rec_t` never touches the ps3 memory, since it seems to be only included `fs_file_t` which only ever gets passed to the ps3 client program via one u32 file descriptor if I saw that right)  I guess I'll merge this after the weekend if no one else gets around to it. |2015-05-09 02:32:28|Bigpet

It is said to be not enough swap, which maybe we can not deal simply.  Even it is not linked due to memory issue, its report of building rpcs3 could provide some help for dev. Lucky the clang version is right, 3.6.1svn. I would close my old pull now.  BTW i know clang uses less memory while compiling but i don't know it would use more while linking. Don't worry about that - we are using its nightly apt packages and it may be solved later (or not). |2015-04-13 16:14:45|Syphurith

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1063|2015-04-13 15:46:49|2015-04-15 16:14:44|That is a sometimes failure, so we would have to detect and catch those manually. And Travis has sometimes locked memory out with no reason. please add these somewhere (for example around line 71 of `.travis.yml`): - `uname -a`: show kernel version - ~~`lsb_release --version` to show Linux Release version. thus with one above we know the host.~~ - `cat /proc/meminfo` to see total swap, and free swap (all linux) - `cat /proc/swaps` to see which swap devices are being used (all linux) - `free -m -t` to see how much free memory left.

Unfortunately we can not stop using those. Also i saw Travis building LLVM. BTW building rpcs3 on Windows is now slow already, take me around 20 minutes, without wx/LLVM.

Also, please take a look at `rpcs3/Emu/SysCalls/lv2/sys_spu.cpp` from 02c263fc19661ac1f866518db48c30697a1293a5 line 514.  ``` C++     if ((group->state <= SPU_THREAD_GROUP_STATUS_INITIALIZED)    (group->state == SPU_THREAD_GROUP_STATUS_WAITING))     {         return CELL_EINVAL;     } ```  Should it return `CELL_EINVAL` and not `CELL_ESTAT` there? If not so please tell me.  BTW I am thinking of merge all these commits into one when confirmed and ready to be merged, cause I was too `verbose` and used too many suggestion from you guys... |2015-04-12 16:50:12|Syphurith

BTW i've seen you doing UI for SaveData, maybe the existing `SaveDataUtility.cpp` could help you a little, though it is only stubbed and just an UI. SaveData should be accessable when no game loaded. Well hope you face no real problems. @tambry How about the left? Tabs in mentioned files are switched to Space. I didn't try to use a tool for these cause Neko's repo is the newest, and i don't wanna cause much edits. Eh.. I don't know who should i call for help in reviewing these codes.. |2015-04-17 19:48:17|Syphurith

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1056|2015-04-09 14:19:44|2015-04-11 12:10:24|By using CppCheck it **seems no severe problems** after these two commits. I don't know RSX much, and i omitted those `uninitMemberVar`,`unreadVariable`,`clarifyCalculation`. I do know those are still code fragments and should not expect to build now. If you please you can read the result XML file from [Here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jGGJxf4) with Pass `37qc`. To read the log, you may have to create a cppcheck project file, use cppcheck gui/cli to open rpcs3 codebase as its root dir, and include at least the folder named `rpcs3` and `Utilities`to create it. Open, then stop the checking and load the result XML. Also you can just let it finish the check to get a newer result.  BTW i would like to try build it to figure out some more warnings generated by Compiler. |2015-04-11 06:46:10|Syphurith
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1056|2015-04-09 14:19:44|2015-04-11 12:10:24|@raven02 I checked the log when building this patched rsx branch. Log contains plenty of warnings, such as `C4351` for some elements, unused property as `size`, and many convert int to float or the otherwise. En, I omitted those `data loss` when u64 to u32.. Well all seems ok for me.. but there are a few ones unsure. from `GLProcTable.h` there redirect some GL functions, and some of them use `float` type param instead of int which is used in actual program. If that is you tried to pass what from elfs it may not be a problem. Most of the corresponding code are in `GLBuffers.h`. Similiar, in `GLFragmentProgram.cpp`:259 tried to pass a `int` to `f32`. I don't know which of those is done intentionally, so i don't use comment to mark those. If you need the log you may build it yourself to see those, and search for `rsx`. Hope these are not real troubles and your work can proceed smoothly. |2015-04-11 09:17:14|Syphurith

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1056|2015-04-09 14:19:44|2015-04-11 12:10:24|@Hykem I've seen the original `RPCS3/rsx` deleted by accident. Code and project has `<<<<` inside. I have an easier way for you to restore it totally, and this needs @raven02 's help. Today i got a bad IP and can not come to see you on IRC, so long things short. - `raven02/rsx` was forked from `RPCS3/rsx` you can use this branch. - Find the commit where `rsx` branch was created from raven02's repo. - Delete current `RPCS3/rsx` branch again, and create branch `RPCS3/rsx` with same start point. You can head to `coverity_scan` and find this commit aafd5c01811386d0fe50165a58b081d042e7cd1a and create it here, as on `raven02/rsx`. - Then let raven02 start a new pull, try to merge his `raven02/rsx` to main `RPCS3/rsx`. - Merge those greedly.  Reason for git: When a commit is just after another parent, it could be merged. If a branch has the same branch start point (commit) it could be regarded as the same branch. So this trick should work.  BTW for raven02: please not delete/sync your `raven02/rsx` using `RPCS3/rsx` currently or else it would be much more difficulty to restore.. Else if you accept to clean up the code there. |2015-04-13 06:02:39|Syphurith
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1054|2015-04-09 07:22:43|2015-04-12 13:51:04|if you wonder why this pull failed the Travis check.. This commit doesn't include any changes to those C/C++ code, but only include a fix for our Travis setting. After this the travis start to build rpcs3 really, and its clang compilation failed when it crashed while compiling file `/Emu/Cell/RawSPUThread.cpp`. The gcc build seems to be fine, with some warnings. After 6627cc96669b5decfab0459f3c522851317b9554 the travis failed to execute the command and it just build LLVM and stop.  Besides, don't know why clang failed while compiling the file. |2015-04-09 08:53:09|Syphurith

My network isn't stable (in China), currently i can not access to Travis log. Sorry. If you know, or have figured out how to fix the clang build don't hesitate to fork and commit, and `@` some of us to take a look or even make a pull request. BTW, re-run the build this time may not work. The seperated version of this commit also segfault (see #1051). At least i saw all those builds failed after fixed travis setting, and at least two of them is segfault. |2015-04-09 09:15:43|Syphurith
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1054|2015-04-09 07:22:43|2015-04-12 13:51:04|Also i found that settings for traivs and appveyor from [citra](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/blob/master/.travis.yml) looks **quite smart**. They wrote the commands into a Shell file for each stage, and let it do the upload job (through ftp) when succussfully build - so no real buildbot or other similiar settings needed then. @Nekotekina @Bigpet @tambry @B1ackDaemon Eh what do you think of their shell files? Well maybe i should talk about this in the forum.. And, travis uploads its Linux/OSX builds, while appveyor uploads the Win builds.. |2015-04-09 12:33:23|Syphurith

I don't know much about the Windows command line but I've found some references to `!var!` being "delayed evaluation" or something.  Could you maybe explain the reason behind that change a little bit better than "works for me"  edit: yeah, looking at [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14347038/dos-batch-why-are-my-set-commands-resulting-in-nothing-getting-stored/14347131#14347131) makes it seem like the `%GIT%` is wrong and the original `!GIT!` was right |2015-04-09 13:06:04|Bigpet
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1054|2015-04-09 07:22:43|2015-04-12 13:51:04|@Bigpet Well at least the `!GIT!` doesn't work for me.. Wait a while and let me find some clues about it. _Don't need to care about the results in a command line window. This is Script file related only._ the Delayed Expansion must be stated before use, as [This Answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13205093) Shown.  ``` @echo off setlocal enableDelayedExpansion  for /f %%i in ('echo aaa/') do set REPO=%%i if "%REPO%"=="" (   echo No input ) else (   echo %REPO:~-1%   echo %REPO:~0,-1%   if %REPO:~-1%==/ set REPO=%REPO:~0,-1%   echo !REPO! )  endlocal ```  You would need to `Delayed expansion must be enabled before you can use it.` And [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10558905). Already changed it back to `!GIT!`. That's my System vars broke the intent indeed. |2015-04-09 13:10:02|Syphurith

I'd set GIT to the base folder of my Msysgit/PortableGit installation. So that is my fault. Well since i changed the name and revert the change it now works. Would revert that change. |2015-04-09 13:29:41|Syphurith

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/1054|2015-04-09 07:22:43|2015-04-12 13:51:04|Besides i don't know should we one day use an updated version of clang. [Ref](https://github.com/SebastianNiemann/Mantella/blob/master/.travis.yml) showed an easier way to achieve the update of gcc/clang/cmake. (Even indeed i am not interested in that project) From [Nightly packages](http://llvm.org/apt/) we may even get clang 3.6 toolchain such as [this(JP)](http://mogproject.blogspot.com/2015/02/c-how-to-build-with-clang-35-in-travis.html).  Else this one from [ldc](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/blob/master/.travis.yml) can be picked as an example. I would give that a try later, and hope that wouldn't mess up our normal pull requests.  **EDIT, Clang updated to 3.6 in #1057** |2015-04-09 16:02:54|Syphurith

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/976|2015-01-24 19:51:50|2015-01-27 14:54:59|Well, this PR seems inaccurate.  1) return{} is removed only in 3 places but appears in 11. 2) PPUThread.h and vfsDirBase.h - totally not sure about this. 3) cellGcmSys: seems broken because m_frequency_mode value is not set for all cases. 4) cellSync: I cannot confirm that it should always return CELL_SYNC_ERROR_AGAIN, it requires reversing. I'm planning to check it. And the whole assignment to "res" and checking it would be dead code, not only "break". 5) cellMsgDialog: it better be changed from TTY to HLE, because printing it to TTY makes no sense. 6) cellMsgDialog: sprintf_s is not portable, I'm not sure why travis didn't fail on it. Better to leave sprintf. 7) CompilerElf.cpp: not sure why this code is commented. Anyway it's better to use // style on every line. VS will do it with Ctrl+K,C combination while all lines are selected with mouse cursor "mirrored". |2015-01-25 13:55:16|Nekotekina

If you are referring to the Travis build failure, that was caused by a gcc internal error (which happens randomly and is unrelated to the changes I made):  2768g++-4.8: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus) 2769Please submit a full bug report, 2770with preprocessed source if appropriate. 2771See file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.8/README.Bugs for instructions. 2772make[2]: **\* [rpcs3/CMakeFiles/rpcs3.dir/Gui/DisAsmFrame.cpp.o] Error 4 2773make[2]: **\* Waiting for unfinished jobs.... 2774g++-4.8: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus) 2775Please submit a full bug report, 2776with preprocessed source if appropriate. 2777See file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.8/README.Bugs for instructions. 2778make[2]: **\* [rpcs3/CMakeFiles/rpcs3.dir/Gui/InterpreterDisAsm.cpp.o] Error 4 2779make[1]: **\* [rpcs3/CMakeFiles/rpcs3.dir/all] Error 2 2780make: **\* [all] Error 2  Clang was able to finish the task without any issues. |2014-11-11 06:14:26|gopalsr83
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/851|2014-10-26 17:07:46|2014-11-04 16:30:09|Although modifying the auto-generated project files works for now it could be a problem in the future since we don't know how CMake, LLVM or VS will change.  If there is consensus that LLVM is adding too much bloat to rpcs3 then I can try and make a .dll of the LLVM libs and have rpcs3 link to the LLVM dll at runtime (GetProcAddress/dlsym). The LLVM headers will still have to remain in the repository. |2014-10-26 20:09:44|gopalsr83
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/851|2014-10-26 17:07:46|2014-11-04 16:30:09|Well if we update llvm we need to rebuild it anyway, I recognize that this is very fragile solution, which is why I didn't delete the llvm_build.vcxproj  Here's the deal, what we need most is more people working on rpcs3, so one of the very crucial things to me is how easy it is to get your own build up and start tinkering with the code.  I know we are still sorely lacking in the most important part, the documentation. But takes a lot longer than to do something as trivial as providing an easy build.  It may seem trivial to just require "well just install cmake and python and put it in your PATH" and you may say "well if they can't even do that then how are they gonna contribute". But the fact is that before people even seriously consider contributing, they try to build it. I saw projects being set up all modular and supposedly easy and "the right way" but when you need to comb through a bunch of dependencies and/or set up a bunch of property sheets people can easily get frustrated.  The download size of ffmpeg is already rather large, so I can't really complain about the download size of llvm (but it's the reason why I didn't opt to just add prebuild binaries, no reason to make the problem worse), but I'm going to try to find binaries to download for travis at the very least (as we did with wx), since the build time increase is a little much for my taste and we won't be changing llvm code. |2014-10-26 20:39:14|Bigpet
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/851|2014-10-26 17:07:46|2014-11-04 16:30:09|Regarding binaries for travis: Linux binaries for LLVM are available at http://llvm.org/apt/. The reason why the travis script was modified to build LLVM from source instead of just installing the apt package is that travis uses Ubuntu precise and the package for Ubuntu precise from http://llvm.org/apt/ does not have the proper CMake scripts. For Ubuntu trusty you can install the LLVM development packages and don't need to compile the LLVM source. |2014-10-26 20:51:35|gopalsr83
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/851|2014-10-26 17:07:46|2014-11-04 16:30:09|Travis should switch to Trusty in the foreseeable future. It will make builds a lot easier/faster. |2014-10-27 14:47:49|danilaml

I might get around to give it a shot this weekend, but I need to deal with some other stuff, so if you got the time you can take a shot at it (I imagine additional VS configurations "LLVM - Release" and "LLVM - Debug" while making the default configurations not build llvm, as in remove the "Build" flag in the configuration manager for the llvm-build.vcxproj ). |2014-10-30 21:19:53|Bigpet

I thought the buttons automatically closed the window so the event ID would go with a close event too.  So, the button now causes `onClose` (which we should probably rename at this point) and wxID_OK and wxID_CANCEL is also handled by the parent dialog class which then closes the window. |2014-07-15 15:16:54|Bigpet

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/559|2014-07-12 14:56:37|2014-07-12 16:07:43|@xsacha By default *.cpp files inherit the project settings, the project settings say that there's supposed to be precompiled headers, so you need to include the pch in all *.cpp files unless you manually disable pch for that file.  We could just set the file to not compile or not compile with pch but the whole `#if 0` was to make sure that it doesn't compile under linux (because these files were originally not in the *.vcxproj) and I included these empty files in the project afterwards to make their contents easier to search for in msvc and make sure that people don't forget that they're there and re-create them. |2014-07-12 15:15:35|Bigpet

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/322|2014-06-08 09:21:48|2014-06-08 16:36:58|We are not including the emulator headers (Memory, Conlog, System, etc.) on _stdafx.h_ in Linux. So you have to add: `#include "Emu/Memory/Memory.h"` on _SPURSManager.cpp_, after `#include "stdafx.h`. Maybe other headers are required as well. |2014-06-08 10:43:54|AlexAltea
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/319|2014-06-07 09:34:37|2014-06-07 13:23:12|Just FYI: I have found `_cellSpursEventFlagInitialize` does not check its arguments properly. There are two wrappers of this function which give following parameters: `_cellSpursEventFlagInitialize (spurs, 0, eventFlag, clearMode, direction);` `_cellSpursEventFlagInitialize (0, taskset, eventFlag, clearMode, direction);` So the proper check for null pointer errors would be: `if ((!spurs.IsGood() && !taskset.IsGood())    !eventFlag.IsGood())`  But this is not related to your pull request. So, I merged it. :wink:  **EDIT: I took care of this in my last commit.** |2014-06-07 13:23:20|AlexAltea
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/319|2014-06-07 09:34:37|2014-06-07 13:23:12|Another thing to note is that probably something will happen to the event flag if `cellSpursFinalize` or `cellSpursDestroyTaskset2` is called for the corresponding _CellSpurs_ or _CellSpursTaskset_ instance. With the current implementation, event flags are free beings who doesn't belong to anything. Probably that's not what real PS3's do. But this is minor stuff, and the currrent method probably works for most of the cases. :-) |2014-06-07 13:29:30|AlexAltea

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/213|2014-04-28 19:20:15|2014-04-28 21:15:52|Long is the opposite of short.  On Intel:  Byte = char = 8 Short = word = 16 Long = int = doubleword = 32 Long long = quadword = 64  Java defines long as 64.  More modern architectures (that weren't originally 16 bit) define words as 32 bits and halfwords as 16.  But these are more modern - C++ retains long and short just like near and far pointers of old.  Long is the default int (`long = long int = int = signed` - you're allowed to omit the length or sign or etc.) `short int` is also valid.  -[Unknown] |2014-04-29 17:10:26|unknownbrackets

https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/213|2014-04-28 19:20:15|2014-04-28 21:15:52|Windows is always IL32/P64, even on x64.  It is different on Linux (which rpcs3 doesn't even work on right now), but that's simply why it's a bad idea to use long at all.

First: Ubuntu 13.10 (latest stable release) doesn't have a libwxgtk3.0-dev, however it does have a libwxgtk2.8-dev, but I'm not sure if that would work.  Second: There is no CMakeLists.txt, so when I try running `cmake CMakeLists.txt` it complains. |2014-04-13 10:02:02|iirelu
https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/184|2014-04-13 01:24:14|2014-04-13 05:38:55|@iirelu Thanks for catching that! Now that you mentioned it I realize I'm running 14.04 so the 3.0 package might not be in the repo. Have you tried it with the 2.8 package? It might work, the windows builds are using 3.1 but I got it working with 3.0. Otherwise we might want to find a ppa somewhere for 3.0  Also if there is no CMakeLists.txt then it sounds like you are not in the rpcs3 folder. The project's root folder has the VS solution file but the cmake files are only in the rpcs3 subfolder.  @frantisekz Thank you also for catching that, if iirelu gets it building 13.10 I'll leave the correction up to him. |2014-04-13 23:02:22|daniel-dressler

So I suggest to indeed change the last `##` to a `,` and either pass a 0 as the fourth parameter to the calls that now only pass 3 args OR create a second macro called `REG_SUB_EMPTY` that takes care of the empty tables that the 3 arg version of `REG_SUB` currently generates. |2014-04-07 03:01:58|Bigpet
